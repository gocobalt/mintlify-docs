Welcome to Cobalt's API Reference! It allows developers to integrate and automate various functionalities within the Cobalt platform. This guide provides an overview of how to find the API key, descriptions of each available resource, and details about the rate limits of the Cobalt API.

## Finding the Cobalt API Key
To execute API requests, an API key is required. Follow these steps to find your API key:

- Log in to your [Cobalt account](app.gocobalt.io).
- On the dashboard, navigate to `Developer` section under `Settings` in the side menu.
- Under the **Setup** tab, you will find the `API Key` in **Overview** section.
- You can copy the API key for either the **Test environment** or the **Production environment**.

## Using Session Token for Authentication
If you do not want to expose your API Key in the frontend implementation, you can also make the following API Calls by using a Session token in the Header instead of `x-api-key` and `Linked-account-id`:

- Config APIs 
- Config Field APIs

Refer [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/session-token/generate-token-for-linked-account) to understand how you can generate a Session Token for a Linked Account.

## Rate Limits of Cobalt API

Cobalt API has specific rate limits to ensure efficient and fair usage.

**Standard Rate Limit**: 20 events per second.

**Burst Rate Limit**: Allows a burst of 5 events in an instant within a second.


## API Resources
The Cobalt API includes several resources, each serving a specific purpose. Below is a brief description of each resource:

1. **Linked Account**

Linked Accounts refer to the end-users or customers of our users who utilize the integrations built using the Cobalt platform.

2. **Applications**

This resource refers to the integrations that the user has enabled in the Cobalt platform.

3. **Config**

This resource refers to the configs created in Cobalt for each integration.

4. **Event**

This resource refers to the events that are created in Cobalt and are used to trigger workflows in any integration.

5. **Webhooks**

Webhooks allow users subscribe to get real-time notifications when events occur in Cobalt.

6. **Executions**

This resource fetches the details of an execution in Cobalt.

7. **Session Token**

This resource is used to generate a session token to authenticate a linked account.

8. **Cobalt Hosted**

This resource is used to create hosted portal URLs or the properties saved against the session token.

This overview provides the foundational knowledge needed to start working with Cobalt's API. For more detailed information on each API endpoint, refer to the Cobalt API Reference.
