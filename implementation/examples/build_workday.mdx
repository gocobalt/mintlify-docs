title: Build Workday Integration
---

In this guide, we will walk through the essential steps required to build a Workday integration using the Cobalt platform. This process involves three major steps i.e. User Authentication with Workday, Creating Workflows and Using workflows for users.

## Authenticating with Workday integration

To get started, first you need to enable the Workday integration in your account and also setup some basic processes.

<Steps>

<Step title="Enable the Workday App">
### Step 1: Enable the Workday App

After setting up your account, the next step is to enable the Workday app in your Cobalt account.

<Note>Apps cannot be enabled using the API. You will need to enable the app through the UI.</Note>

To enable the Workday app:

Navigate to `Apps` in Cobalt and search for **Workday** and enable the app by clicking on the `Go Live` button in the top right corner.
<img height="200" src="/images/Examples/workday/enable_workday.png" alt="Enable Workday App"/>

Since this is a API Key based app, you do not need to perform any setup for user authentication.
<Tip>
Follow the steps given [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/resources/integration-providers/workday) to get your API credentials required for authentication.
</Tip>

Once the app is enabled, you can proceed to create and manage workflows and linked accounts associated with Workday.
</Step>

<Step title="Create a Linked Account">
### Step 2: Create a Linked Account

A Linked Account in Cobalt represents the end-users or customers who will use the integration through the platform. Each Linked Account requires a unique linked_account_id, which typically corresponds to an ID from your internal data model (e.g., a user or account ID).

<Tip>
Learn more about Linked Accounts [here](/build/basics/linked_account).
</Tip>

To upsert (create or update) a Linked Account, use the following API call:
<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v2/public/linked-account \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "linked_account_id": "<string>",
  "name": "<string>"'
```
</CodeGroup>


| Param | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
|linked_account_id| Mandatory | String | Unique customer identifier|
|name| Optional | String | Name of the customer|

You can check the Linked Accounts in your Cobalt account by navigating to the **Linked Accounts** section in the side menu.

Once the Linked Account is successfully created or updated, it will be ready for authentication in the next step.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate Session Token for your Linked Account">
### Step 3: Generate Token
After creating a Linked Account, the next step is to generate a session token. Session tokens help protect your Cobalt API key and manage end-customer tokens more securely.

To create a session token, use the following API call:
<CodeGroup>
```JavaScript cURL
    curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v2/public/session-token \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "linked_account_id": "<string>"
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

This session token will be included in subsequent requests to Cobalt APIs to authenticate and authorize the actions.
</Step>

<Step title="Open Hosted Portal Auth Flow">
### Step 4: Open Hosted Portal Auth Flow
Next, you will need to generate a Hosted URL that your users will use to authenticate with Salesforce. Cobalt securely stores the credentials and handles API calls on behalf of your users.

Use the following API call to generate the Hosted URL:
<CodeGroup>
```JavaScript cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v2/public/connect-url \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "color": "<string>",
  "bgColor": "<string>",
  "name": "<string>"
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

The response will return a Hosted URL that your users can visit to authenticate and connect their Salesforce accounts.
<Info> Hosted Portal is a no-code solution provided by Cobalt that removes the need to build your own UI for handling integration authentication and configuration. </Info>
</Step>
<Step title="Authenticate Using Hosted Portal">
### Step 5: Perform Key based Authentication

Visit the Hosted URL provided in the API response. The Hosted Portal will display all the integrations you have enabled, including NetSuite.

To authenticate:

- Navigate to the Workday integration in the portal.
- Provide the requested credentials.
- Click on Connect to begin successfully authenticate with Workday.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
You have successfully authenticated with Workday integration.

The next step is to create workflows for your use-case.
</Check>

## Creating Workflows in Workday
There are 2 major categories of workflows that you can create in Workday currently.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Data Import from Workday" icon="download">
    Sync data from Workday to your system.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Push Data to Workday" icon="upload">
    Create data on Workday from your system.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Let's look at a sample workflow for each case.

#### Data Import from Workday
  Consider a use-case where you want to sync all the employees present in Workday to your system.

In the Workday integration, go to `Workflows` and create a new workflow by clicking on `+Add Workflow` button and name it as `Sync Employees`.

<Accordion title="Data Import from Workday">

Follow the steps given to build the workflow:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Trigger in Start Node">

    All workflows start with a trigger, which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow.
   For this workflow we will use the Event Based trigger.
  <Tip>
  Learn more about the triggers and its types [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/workflow/triggering_workflow).
  </Tip>
    Click on the `Start Node`, select your native app option and click on `+ Create New Event`.
<img height="200" src="/images/Examples/workday/event_workday.png" alt="Event for workflow"/>

Give a name to your event and keep the payload as an empty object.
</Step>
<Step title="Add Workday Node">

    Now to fetch all the employees present in your user's account, we need to call Workday API.

    Click on `Nodes` option in the top right and drag the Workday Node from **Native Apps** section to the workflow builder. Connect this node with Start Node. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fetch Employees from Workday using Action">
    Click on the Workday Node and select `Get Workers` action.
    <img height="200" src="/images/Examples/workday/employee_workday.png" alt="Employees Action for workflow"/>
    <Tip>
You can do additional filters in the Get Workers action such as exclude inactive workers and more.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

<Step title="Mapping Employee fields">

  Click on `+ Map Fields` under Input Parameters, add key name as `employees` and in value we will provide the response received through Workday node which will be restructured.

  In `Value`, select **Nodes** tab under Insert Variable and click on `+` of the Workday Node.
    <img height="200" src="/images/Examples/workday/map_workday.png" alt="Mapping API Response for workflow"/>

  You can now do mapping using JavaScript code. Try the sample code provided below:
  ```
function yourFunction(params) {
    const data = params.employees
    return data["env:Envelope"]["env:Body"]["wd:Get_Workers_Response"]["wd:Response_Data"]["wd:Worker"].map((workdata)=>{
  return {
    first_name: workdata["wd:Worker_Descriptor"].split(" ")[0] ?? "",
    last_name: workdata["wd:Worker_Descriptor"].split(" ")[1] ?? "",
    display_name: workdata["wd:Worker_Descriptor"],
    id: workdata["wd:Worker_Reference"]["wd:ID"][0]["_"],
    primary_email: workdata["wd:Worker_Descriptor"].split(" ")[0] + '@workday.com'
  }
})
}
```
</Step>

<Step title="API Proxy in Workflow">
You have successfully fetched all contacts and structured the payload. Now to receive it in your server, you need to configure an API Proxy.

In Cobalt Dashboard, navigate to `Developer` > `API Proxies` and click on `New Action`. Configure an API endpoint, where you want to receive the response.

If you want to test, go to [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) and copy `Your unique URL` and configure this as a POST Request and `Save`.
    <img height="200" src="/images/Examples/salesforce/proxy_salesforce.png" alt="Configuring API Proxy workflow"/>

<Tip>Learn more about API Proxies [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/basics/proxies).</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Use API Proxy in Workflow">
From Native Apps nodes, add your org's Node and connect it with Custom Code.

Click on the node and select the API Proxy that you created from the Actions. Add the response from Custom Code node in data field and click on `Save`.
<Note>
Ensure that you add a field in the API Proxy where you can pass the JSON data and then added it to the API Call body as well in the POST request.
</Note>

</Accordion>


#### Push Data to Workday

Consider a use-case where you want to create an employee present in your system to Workday.

This workflow will be fired when you send an Event with the payload of the contact to be added.

In the Workday integration, go to `Workflows` and create a new workflow by clicking on `+Add Workflow` button and name it as `Create New Employee`.

<Accordion title="Push Data to Workday">
Follow the steps given to build the workflow:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Trigger in Start Node">

    All workflows start with a trigger, which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow.
   For this workflow we will use the Event Based trigger.
  <Tip>
  Learn more about the triggers and its types [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/workflow/triggering_workflow).
  </Tip>
    Click on the `Start Node`, select your native app option and click on `+ Create New Event`.
<img height="200" src="/images/Examples/workday/event_workday_add.png" alt="Event for workflow"/>

Give a name to your event and provide all the data related to the contact in the payload.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Workday Node">
  Now to create a new contact in Workday, we need to call Workday API.

  Click on `Nodes` option in the top right and drag the Workday Node from **Native Apps** section to the workflow builder. Connect this node with Start Node.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Action in node">
    Click on Workday Node and add the `Create Employee` action.
    To provide the data in all the fields from your Event payload, just click on a field and from the **Event** tab under Insert Variable, select the fields from the body that you sent as payload.
    <img height="200" src="/images/Examples/workday/create_workday.png" alt="Create Employee action"/>
<Warning>
Ensure that all the mandatory fields in the action are filled, else the Workday API will give error.
</Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>
<Check>
Hurray!!

You have successfully created a Workday workflow to create a new employee.
</Check>
</Accordion>

<Check>
You have successfully created the workflows for your use case.

Next step is to enable and execute those workflows for your Linked Accounts.
</Check>


## Executing the Workflows

To run these workflows for your users or Linked Accounts, you need to do the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Config for Linked Account">
  Config is a customization that you store for each integration of your end-customers.
  ## Create Config
You can create config for the Linked Account through the Cobalt Connect SDKs or using the APIs.

You can use the **.config()** method or the [Create Config API](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/config/find-or-create-config) which returns the specified config or creates one if it doesn't exist for the Linked Account.

Make a request with the  `Application Slug` and `linked_account_id` as mandatory fields for it. You can request in the following way:
<CodeGroup>
``` JavaScript .config()
cobalt.config({
  slug: "workday",
  config_id: "OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG",
  labels: {}, // optional dynamic labels
})
```
``` JavaScript cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v2/public/config \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'linked_account_id: <linked_account_id>' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "slug": "<string>",
  "config_id": "<string>",
  "labels": {}
}'
```
</CodeGroup>
It will return information about config of the application for the Linked Account and provides you with all the published workflows and settings input for the user required to execute the workflow.
``` JavaScript Response
{
	"slug": "workday",
	"config_id": "OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG",
	"fields": [],
	"workflows": [
		{
			"id": "64d1fac58716dc5065127ffe",
			"name": "Sync Employees",
			"description": "",
			"enabled": false,
			"fields": []
		}
	],
	"field_errors": []
}
```
  
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Workflow">
    Now you need to enable the workflow for your Linked account. You can either ask the user to enable them or you can do so for them by using the [Update Config API](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/config/update-config) or **.updateconfig()** method.

Make the following request:
<CodeGroup>
``` JavaScript Method
cobalt.updateConfig({
  slug: "workday",
  config_id: "OPTIONAL_ID_FOR_THIS_CONFIG",
  fields: {
    "64da0b57c9ae95561bb0a24d": "C044U7Q074J"
  },
  workflows: [
    {
      id: "64d1fac58716dc5065127ffe",
      enabled: true,
      fields: {
        "64da0b57c9ae95561bb0a24f": "C044U7Q074J"
      }

    }
  ]
})
```
``` JavaScript cURL
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v2/public/config \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'linked_account_id: <linked_account_id>' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "slug": "<string>",
  "config_id": "<string>",
  "fields": {
    "64abea6d941ba774d124b19c": "<string>"
  },
  "workflows": [
    {
      "id": "<string>",
      "enabled": true,
      "fields": {
        "64abea6d941ba774d124b19c": "<string>"
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```
</CodeGroup>
In response, you get the updated config information for the application.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Third Step">
    Once the required workflows are enabled, you need to fire event to start execution. You can use the [Trigger Event for app](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/event/trigger-event) API with the following request:
    ```JavaScript cURL
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v2/public/event/:slug \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'linked_account_id: <linked_account_id>' \
    --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
    --data '{
    "event": "<string>",
    "payload": {}
    }'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Execution Logs">
  Once the workflow execution has been fired, you can check the Logs of the workflow [here](https://app.gocobalt.io/logs).

  <Tip>
Learn more about logs and observability [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/maintain/logs).
