title: Develop Test Scenarios
description:

Once you’re able to read and write through Cobalt, the next step is to create a robust testing, validation, and maintenance plan for your API integration workflows. This will help you achieve greater reliability, accuracy, and performance after launch. In this guide, we’ll help you build a testing plan to identify potential issues early and ensure that your application is working effectively.

### 1. Develop comprehensive test scenarios

Create a testing plan that outlines various scenarios, edge cases, and expected outcomes for your integration in Cobalt. Include both successful and unsuccessful cases, such as proper handling of errors types. Ensure that your test plan covers all relevant aspects of your Cobalt API integration, including authorization, API requests, data processing, and data storage.

### 2. Writing Automated tests

Leverage automated testing tools and frameworks to run your tests and validate common and uncommon API or method call responses. Automated testing will help you identify any issues or inconsistencies (like empty data fields or config) in your integration, and allow you to quickly address them before deploying your application to production. Regularly update your test cases as your integration involves more workflows to ensure comprehensive coverage:

- How does your application respond when a user needs to be reauthenticated?
<Tip>
Learn more about [How to handle ReAuth](https://docs.gocobalt.io/ship/auth_flows/re-auth-flow) in Cobalt in our Additional section.
</Tip>
- How is a user properly disconnected from the integration?

### 3. Perform manual testing of Cobalt auth flows

In addition to automated tests, perform manual testing of the frontend Cobalt auth flow to validate its proper functionality and desired user experience. This may include end-to-end testing, where you simulate a user’s interaction with your application and verify that the integration connects correctly and subsequent API calls are initiated.
- What happens after Cobalt Connect closes after a successful connection? Where does the user go next?
- What happens after Cobalt Connect modal closes unsuccessfully (like invalid user credentials)?

### 4. Conduct regular reviews
Periodically review your Cobalt integration to ensure it continues to meet your application’s needs and performance requirements. Look for opportunities to optimize your integration, such as refining your workflows, improving error handling, or exploring new Cobalt integrations.

## Checkpoint + Next Step

After completing this step, you now have a robust and reliable integration on your end that meets the needs of your users. Next, we will see how you can perform [Node level tests](https://docs.gocobalt.io/implementation/Test-Integration/node-test) of your Workflows.
