## Enable & Configure Apps
The end customers can have access to apps enabled by the user. You just need to select from any of the available applications in the [Apps](https://app.gocobalt.io/apps) section of the platform and enable it by clicking on `Go Live`.

There are 2 types of Authentication possible for any integration offered:
<Accordion title="Key Based Apps">
For API key auth based applications, no configuration is required on the Cobalt dashboard. You just need to enable the application. Your customer would provide the details in the auth flow portal.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="OAuth Apps" defaultOpen="true">
In the app `Settings` section, provide the required details under the `Configure Credentials` section. 

You should use your own OAuth app credentials such as `Client ID`, `Client Secret` etc. This will make sure that users see your brand instead of Cobalt when they connect integrations.

<Tip>
Some **OAuth** apps by default use Cobalt credentials. This makes it easy to get started and connect integrations right away.
