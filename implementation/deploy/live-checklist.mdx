title: Checklist
description: Validate that your application is ready for deployment with the Cobalt go-live checklist.
---
If you have followed the [Implementation Guide](https://docs.gocobalt.io/implementation/overview) completely, your application is ready for deployment. The following checklist is focused list of recommendations to validate that your application is ready for deployment. This will ensure a seamless experience for your customers, make your integration more robust and secure, and set you up for success when you launch into production.

## Integrate Cobalt Auth flow 

Cobalt auth flows lets your users connect their integration accounts. It stores the credentials securely and lets you make authorized API calls on your users’ behalf.

- [Integrate Cobalt auth flows](https://docs.gocobalt.io/ship/auth_flows/flows) into your application’s frontend. It should be displayed as a part of your onboarding flow, preferably behind an authentication login.
- [Create Session Tokens](https://docs.gocobalt.io/implementation/integrate/get-access-token) for your linked accounts.

**Design a seamless connection experience**
- Create a smooth frontend to [display the integrations](https://docs.gocobalt.io/implementation/integrate/display-apps) to your customers.
- [Create a Linked Account](https://docs.gocobalt.io/implementation/integrate/setup-linked-account) for the user whenever he signs up to the platform.
- **Display Auth text** to your customer when they want to connect to an integration. If the application is key-based, provide them the instructions to get the API Key.

## Configure Integration 

Configure the integration that you want to enable for your customers, correctly in the Cobalt Dashboard.
- Ensure that the correct Client ID and Client Secret are used in the OAuth app Setup.
- Check if the Callback URL provided by Cobalt has been added to your OAuth app.
- The scopes selected in the OAuth app should be correct for the actions that you want to perform.

## Integrate Cobalt API or SDK

Following steps are recommended to build a resilient integration using the API or SDK.
- [Integrate the Cobalt APIs](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/customer/get-linked-account) or SDKs for Listing Applications, Config etc. into your application’s backend.

**Handle Responses**
- Parse through the response received and use the required fields from it.

**Handle Errors**
- Your application should be able to handle errors you may receive from API Call or SDK Method call.
- [Handle Re-Authentication](https://docs.gocobalt.io/ship/auth_flows/re-auth-flow) of users if required for any application.

## Workflows implementation
It is necessary to ensure that the Workflows created for your users are logically optimal and are able to provide the required functionality.
- Ensure that the Workflow created is optimized and can provide the required functionality covering all the cases with minimum no. of nodes.
- **Workflow Failures** and error cases are properly handled on your platform.
- Check if the access of a workflow is provided to the required Linked accounts or not using the **Access Control**.

**Actions and Triggers of the Workflow**
For a workflow, it is essential that the correct information is read and write.
- The [payload created in Events](https://docs.gocobalt.io/implementation/communicate/write-data) should be such that all the required information is available in it.
- The workflow should be able to provide proper information for the [API Proxies to read](https://docs.gocobalt.io/implementation/communicate/get-data).

**Testing Workflows**
- All the [nodes of a workflow](https://docs.gocobalt.io/implementation/Test-Integration/node-test) should be tested and the errors should be handled.
- [Workflow testing](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/workflow/workflow_testing) will make sure that the Workflow is able to provide the required functionality.

## Test the integration and go live
Before going live, it is valuable to know the test scenarios for your Cobalt integration.
- An integration involves different [test scenarios](https://docs.gocobalt.io/implementation/Test-Integration/develop-test) which should be thoroughly tested.
- Some integrations provide free Sandbox/trial accounts which should be used for testing before going live.

## Support
The following steps will ensure you and your team is set up for success once your Cobalt integration has gone live.
- You can contact Cobalt Support either by sending an email to `integrations@gocobalt.io`, or `@Cobalt Support` if you have a shared Slack channel with Cobalt.
