7. Now navigate to `Subscriber Tenants` option in the side menu and click on `Add to tenant`. Add all the tenants here for which you want to enable the OAuth app and click on `Add`.
<Note>
This step is necessary, otherwise the tenant will not be able to perform Auth with the app.
</Note>


#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Provide the acquired Client ID and Client Secret under Settings of the app and save it.
