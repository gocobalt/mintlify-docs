## Creating a Teams bot

#### New Bot creation steps
To create a Microsoft Teams bot, please follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Log in to your [Microsoft Developer Portal for Teams](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/).
2. Navigate to `Tools` in the side menu and select `Bot Management`.
<img height="200" src="/images/Msteams/teams_bot.png" alt="Navigation for Bot setup"/>
3. Click on `+ New Bot` > provide a **Name** and click on `Add`. It's recommended to append a word like `Bot` so that it's easy to identify this later on.

#### Associate Teams bot to application

Now, you need to associate this bot with your Teams application.

1. In the Teams Developer Portal, navigate to `Apps` in the side menu.
2. If you do not have a Teams app yet, click New app and provide a name. This name will be the one displayed in the Microsoft Teams store and to your users.

    - In `Basic information`, you need to provide a **short description** and **URLs** for your application's website, Privacy Policy, and Terms of Use.

    - Click `Save` below.
    <Note>
    Ensure that all the fields for App in `Basic information` are provided, otherwise it gives error while uploading the app in Teams for testing.
    </Note>
3. Under `Configure` in the side menu of the app, click on `App features`.
4. Select `Bot` and choose the Bot that you created above in `Select an existing bot`, choose capabilities as applicable and click on `Save` below.

#### Testing Microsoft Teams Bot

If your app is not published on the Microsoft Teams App Store, then follow the steps given to test your app in Teams:

1. In your [Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/home), go to the `App` created for testing.
2. Click on the triple-dot menu of the app and choose `Download app package` option. The package will get downloaded as a **.zip** file.
<img height="200" src="/images/Msteams/download_app.png" alt="Downloading App package"/>

3. Go to the [Microsoft Teams account](https://teams.microsoft.com/v2/) in which you would like to test the app and it's authentication.
<Note>
You will not be able to login into the platform correctly if appropriate license or permissions are missing.
</Note>
4. Click `Apps` option in the side menu and click on `Manage your apps` option at the bottom.
5. Click on `Upload An App` and `Upload your app to your org's app catalog` and select the .zip file that you downloaded and you will be navigated to the `Built for your org` page.
<img height="200" src="/images/Msteams/teams_upload.png" alt="Upload App package for testing"/>

<Tip>
If you uploaded the app through `Submit an app to your org` option, then the admin can approve it by going to [Teams Admin Centre](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/) > `Teams Apps` > `Manage Apps` > Search for the app that you submitted > Click on the app name to open its app details page and change the status to `Allowed`.

Refer [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/manage-apps).
</Tip>
6. After a successfull upload, select your app. Click on `Add` and `Add to a team` and add the bot to a team and a channel.

#### Enable Microsoft Teams Bot for all users in an org

If you want to use the Proactive Messaging action i.e. **Post notification to a user as a bot**, then Teams require you to have the Bot installed in Teams account of all the users of the org who can receive message from the bot.

If you do not want to inform all the users to install the bot from `Apps` in Teams, you can also ask the Teams **Admin** to install the app by default for all the users. Follow the steps below to do this:

- Sign in to [Teams Admin Centre](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/) > Navigate to `Teams apps` > Select `Setup policies` in the side menu.
- Select `Global (Org-wide default)` under **Manage Policies**.
<img height="200" src="/images/Msteams/enable_all.png" alt="Enable Bot for all users in organization"/>
- Under **Installed Apps** > Click on `Add Apps` > Search for your **Bot** by its name > Select it > click on `Add` and finally click on `Save`.

The bot will now be installed by default on all the users within the Teams org.

## Creating an app in Microsoft Azure

1. Log in to your [Microsoft Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/).

10. Navigate to `Overview` in the side menu > `Essentials` tab > Copy the **Client ID** under `Application (client) ID` and **Tenant ID** under `Directory (tenant) ID`.
<img height="200" src="/images/Msteams/teams_id.png" alt="Getting Client ID"/>

11. For your **App ID** or Bot External ID, go to `Apps` in Teams Developer Portal, select your App which was created earlier and copy the `App ID` present under **Basic Information** of the app.
<img height="200" src="/images/Msteams/teams_app_id.png" alt="Getting Client ID"/>

## Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

<img height="200" src="/images/Msteams/teams_cobalt.png" alt="Setting up application client credentials"/>

Provide the acquired Client ID and Client Secret under Settings of the app and save it.

## Configuring Scopes
Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under `Permissions & Scopes`
section. 

For some applications Cobalt sets **mandatory scopes** which cannot be removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any 
custom scopes supported by the respective platform.
<img height="200" src="/images/Msteams/teams_scopes.png" alt="OAuth Scopes"/>

Once the scopes has been added to the application in Cobalt, go to your [Microsoft Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/) and update the scopes as added on Cobalt.

Select the OAuth App created for Cobalt and follow **Step 6** and **7** [above](https://docs.gocobalt.io/resources/integration-providers/ms_teams#creating-an-app-in-microsoft-azure).

<Warning>
If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform. And, the scopes selected here are
identical to the ones selected in the platform.
</Warning>

## Actions and triggers
