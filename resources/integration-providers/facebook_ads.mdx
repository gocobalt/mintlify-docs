<Warning> App Type cannot be changed after the app has been created.</Warning>
4. Enter the **App Name** for your application and click on `Create App`.
5. Go to your [`Apps catalog`](https://app.gocobalt.io/apps) in **Cobalt** > Search for `Facebook Ads` > `Settings` > `Use your credentials` > `Callback Url` > Copy it.
6. Click on `Add Product` in the left menu > Click on `Set Up` under **Facebook Login for Business** > Paste the Callback Url under **Valid OAuth Redirect URIs** and click on `Save changes`.

#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting `Use our credentials`. However, if you wish to use your own application,
select `Use your own credentials`. Provide the aquired Client Id and Client secret and save it.

#### Facebook Ads Single Webhook URL
If you wish to create an orchestration where a workflow is being triggered when some operation occurs in Facebook Ads, you'd need to subscribe to Facebook Ads' Webhook. Cobalt provides
a single webhook URL to manage such event triggers for all your customers.

**To setup Facebook Ads webhook subscription:**

1. Select **Facebook Ads** from the application list in **Cobalt**, and select `Settings`.
2. Copy the `Single Webhook Url`.
3. Go to OAuth app of Facebook Ads > Click on `Add Product` in the left menu > Click on `Set Up` under **Webhooks**. 
4. Select **Page** object from drop-down and click `Subscribe to this object`. Paste the **Single Webhook URL** under `Callback URL` and the **Verify token** as `cobalt_verify_token`. Click on `Verify and save`.
<Note>
Ensure that the verify token entered is `cobalt_verify_token`. No other value will be able to verify the Webhook.
</Note>

**Test the Webhooks**

<Info>
Webhooks can be only tested while the App Mode is `Live`.
</Info>

- Toggle on the **App Mode** from `Development` to `Live`. You can test the Lead Ads Webhook at the Facebook Ads testing tool [here](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing/).

#### App Review for Facebook Ads

If the app will only be used by app users who have a role on the app itself, **App Review** is not required but if the app will be used by anyone without a [**Role on the app**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development#roles) or a [**role in a Business**](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/442345745885606?id=180505742745347) that has claimed the app, it must first undergo App Review by Meta.

<Tip>
Follow the detailed steps for an App Review submission given in the guide [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/resp-plat-initiatives/app-review/submission-guide).
</Tip>

Once approved, you can change the **Mode** of the app to `Live` by using the Toggle given in top Nav bar of the OAuth app.
