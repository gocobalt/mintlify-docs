#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Provide the acquired Client Id and Client secret under Settings of the app and save it.

#### Configuring Scopes
Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under `Permissions & Scopes`
section. 

For some applications Cobalt sets **mandatory scopes** which cannot be removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any 
custom scopes supported by the respective platform.

Once the scopes has been added to the application in Cobalt, go to your [HighLevel Marketplace account](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/) and update the scopes as added on Cobalt.

Select the OAuth App created for Cobalt > Click on `Settings` in side menu > Add the scopes as added in Cobalt under **Scopes** section > Click on `Save`. 

<Warning>
If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform. And, the scopes selected here are
identical to the ones selected in the platform.
</Warning>

#### HighLevel Single Webhook URL

<Info>
To get the User Events through Webhooks in High Level, the OAuth app needs to be submitted for review and published.
</Info>
If you wish to create an orchestration where a workflow is being triggered when some operation occurs in High Level, you'd need to subscribe to High Level's Webhook. Cobalt provides
a single webhook URL to manage such event triggers for all your customers.

**To setup High Level webhook subscription:**

1. Select High Level from the application list in **Cobalt**, and select `Settings`.
2. Copy the `Single Webhook Url`
3. Go to `My Apps` > Choose your OAuth app > `Settings` > `Webhooks`.
4. Subscribe to the events for which you want to configure the Webhooks.
<Note>Webhook Events will be disabled in High Level app if the appropriate scopes are not added to the OAuth app.</Note>
5. Scroll down, paste the `Single Webhook Url` inside the **Webhook URL** section and click on `Save`.
