#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Provide the acquired Client ID and Client Secret under Settings of the app and save it.
