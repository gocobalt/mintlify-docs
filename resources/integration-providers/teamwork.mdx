Cobalt offers both **Key Based** and **OAuth 2.0** integration for Teamwork. In this guide, we will look at the OAuth App setup process.

To setup your Teamwork app in Cobalt for OAuth, you will need the following credentials from your [Teamwork Developer account](https://apidocs.teamwork.com/guides/teamwork/developer-portal#how-do-i-access-the-developer-portal):
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes

### Pre-requisites

1. Teamwork Developer account. You can create one [here](https://www.teamwork.com/signup/).

<Info>If you haven't already created an app in Teamwork, you'd need to create one.</Info>

### Creating an app in Teamwork

To create a Teamwork app and acquire the above mentioned credentials, please follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Log in to your Teamwork Developer account.
2. Click on `Create an app` button in the top right corner.

3. Go to your [`Apps catalog`](https://app.gocobalt.io/apps) in **Cobalt** > Search for `Teamwork` > `Settings` > `Use your credentials` > `Callback Url` > Copy it.
4. Enter the `Name` for your application > Choose `Product` as **Teamwork** > Paste the Callback Url under `Redirect URIs` and click on `Create App` button.
5. Click on the app created, go to the **Credentials** tab and copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Provide the acquired Client ID and Client Secret under Settings of the app and save it.

#### Publishing Teamwork App
When the app is created in the Teamwork Developer Portal, it's status is shown as **In development**. This means your app is currently in development mode and it can only be used by the Teamwork account it was created under.

Once you are ready to publish your app and make it available to all Teamwork users, please contact integrations@teamwork.com.
