Cobalt offers both **Key Based** and **OAuth 2.0** integration for PagerDuty. In this guide, we will look at the OAuth App setup process.

To setup your PagerDuty app in Cobalt for OAuth, you will need the following credentials from your [PagerDuty account](https://identity.pagerduty.com/global/authn/authentication/PagerDutyGlobalLogin/enter_email):
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes

### Pre-requisites

1. PagerDuty Developer account. You can create one [here](https://developer.pagerduty.com/sign-up/).

<Info>If you haven't already created an app in PagerDuty, you'd need to create one.</Info>

### Creating an app in PagerDuty

To create a PagerDuty app and acquire the above mentioned credentials, please follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Log in to your PagerDuty account.
2. Click on the `Integrations` option in the top nav bar and select `App Registration` button.

#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Provide the acquired Client ID and Client Secret under Settings of the app and save it.

#### Configuring Scopes
Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under `Permissions & Scopes`
section. 

For some applications Cobalt sets **mandatory scopes** which cannot be removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any 
custom scopes supported by the respective platform.

Once the scopes has been added to the application in Cobalt, go to your PagerDuty account and update the scopes as added on Cobalt.

Select the OAuth App created for Cobalt > Click on `Edit` in the left side > Click on `Manage` under **OAuth 2.0** > Add the scopes as added in Cobalt > Click on `Confirm Changes`. 
<Warning>
If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform. And, the scopes selected here are
identical to the ones selected in the platform.
</Warning>

#### Making PagerDuty App Public

In PagerDuty, a **Public App** allows the app to be used by anyone.

To make your app public, select `App Type` as **Public** and fill the **Distribution Form** provided to you.


#### Actions and triggers
Once the above setup is completed, you can create orchestrations of your use-cases using PagerDuty actions and triggers. Following are the set of PagerDuty actions and triggers
