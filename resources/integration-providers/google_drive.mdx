## Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth2` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Provide the acquired Client Id and Client secret under Settings of the app and save it.

## Configuring Scopes
Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under `Permissions & Scopes`
section. 

For some applications Cobalt sets **mandatory scopes** which cannot be removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any 
custom scopes supported by the respective platform.
<img height="200" src="/images/Googledrive/drive_scopes.png" alt="OAuth Scopes"/>

Once the scopes has been added to the project in Cobalt, go to your [Google Cloud Console dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard?supportedpurview=project) and update the scopes as added on Cobalt.

Navigate to  `Cloud Console dashboard` > Select the **Project** created for Cobalt > Follow the steps 8 and 9 mentioned [above](https://docs.gocobalt.io/resources/integration-providers/google_drive#creating-an-app-in-google-drive) for adding scopes. 

<Warning>
If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform. And, the scopes selected here are
identical to the ones selected in the platform.
</Warning>

## App Review for Google Drive

Projects configured with a publishing status of `In production` are available to any user with a Google Account. Projects configured with a publishing status of In production should complete the verification process, including defining scopes actively requested by your project's OAuth clients, if it meets one or more of the OAuth verification criteria.

### To submit app for review
- In the Project, go to `OAuth consent screen` in the left menu under **APIs and services** > Choose the App type as `External` and click on `Publish App` button.
- Click on `Prepare for Verification` and provide the required information.
- You will be required to submit justification for the scopes requested and a demo video on YouTube which shows the scopes being used.
