To setup your Lever app in Cobalt for OAuth, you will need the following sandbox credentials from your [Lever sandbox developer account](https://hire.sandbox.lever.co/settings/integrations?tab=oauth):
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes

### Required Settings

* **Mandatory Scopes**

2. webhooks:write:admin

<Info>If you haven't already created an app in Lever, you'd need to create one.</Info>

### Creating an app in Lever

<Note>
Lever follows a process to provide its partners credentials through their [Partnership Interest Form](https://www.lever.co/partnershipinterest/) submission. A Lever sandbox is required to register for an OAuth app to get access to a `Client Id` & `Client Secret`.
For more details on becoming a partner on Lever, follow this [link](https://partnerexperience.lever.co/hc/en-us/articles/5136514106253-Getting-Started).
</Note>

Once you have access to a Lever Sandbox, [register for an OAuth app](https://hello.lever.co/api/mailings/click/PMRHK4TMEI5CE2DUORYHGORPF5UGS4TFFZZWC3TEMJXXQLTMMV3GK4ROMNXS643FOR2GS3THOMXWS3TUMVTXEYLUNFXW44Z7ORQWEPLPMF2XI2BCFQRHMZLSONUW63RCHIRDIIRMEJUWIIR2EIYTEMBSGUZTIIRMEJXXEZZCHIRGKMBRGU4TGMJUFUZDMZRZFU2DCOLCFVRDCOBQFUZDMYJWMMZWEYZRMVRGKIRMEJZWSZZCHIRHS5SGGQ3WC2DBNZLFCX2ROVCTCWTFMNEVSZ3KKZLUCSCTJVMC2WKLJRHU2T3XJFDGUURYHURH2===) 
to retrieve your credentials. To request any changes to the app (e.g. scopes, callbacks) you can contact Lever's Partner Support team by [opening a ticket](https://hello.lever.co/api/mailings/click/PMRHK4TMEI5CE2DUORYHGORPF5YGC4TUNZSXEZLYOBSXE2LFNZRWKLTMMV3GK4ROMNXS62DDF5SW4LLVOMXXEZLROVSXG5DTF5XGK5ZCFQRHMZLSONUW63RCHIRDIIRMEJUWIIR2EIYTEMBSGUZTIIRMEJXXEZZCHIRGKMBRGU4TGMJUFUZDMZRZFU2DCOLCFVRDCOBQFUZDMYJWMMZWEYZRMVRGKIRMEJZWSZZCHIRE42CDFUZXKRKCNZKGIYSUL4ZTGR22HBMXKUBSJ5UG4NCFPBKDS4JXFVSGUYJWGNSTQ4RUHURH2===). 

To create a Lever sandbox account please provide the following details:

1. **Integration name** - Name of your Company/Product
2. **Product description**
3. **Callback URI** - https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v1/lever/callback
4. **Logo** - A square logo of your product or company
5. **Scopes** - Lever recommends its users to review Lever's [use cases](https://hire.sandbox.lever.co/developer/usecases) to understand what scopes to request for,
prior to registering for a Sandbox App. It's helpful to select a broad set of scopes for testing the integration as revisions to the scope configuration on Lever will require reaching out to Lever's Partner Experience team by [opening a ticket](https://partnerexperience.lever.co/hc/en-us/requests/new) or 
emailing a member of their Partner Experience team.

Below are the list of scopes that you should request to be included.

`offline_access`, `applications:read:admin`, `archive_reasons:read:admin`, `contact:write:admin`, `feedback:write:admin`, `files:write:admin`, `forms:write:admin`,
`interviews:write:admin`, `notes:write:admin`, `offers:read:admin`, `opportunities:write:admin`, `panels:write:admin`, `postings:write:admin`, `referrals:read:admin`,
`requisition_fields:write:admin`, `requisitions:write:admin`, `resumes:read:admin`, `sources:read:admin`, `stages:read:admin`, `tags:read:admin`, `uploads:write:admin`,
`users:write:admin`, `webhooks:write:admin`


#### Configuring Lever credentials in Cobalt

App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Provide the acquired Client Id and Client secret under Settings of the app and save it.

#### Requesting permissions from your customers
Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under `Permissions & Scopes`
section. 

Make sure that you only select among the scopes that were earlier requested to be added to your sandbox account. Click on save changes after selecting the scopes.

That's it, your users can now connect with your Lever applications through their [auth flow](https://docs.gocobalt.io/concepts/auth-flows) setups. They would be requested permissions as per the scopes selected
by you on the Cobalt app settings page.

<Warning>
If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform. And, the scopes selected here are
among the ones requested for Lever sandbox account.
</Warning>
