#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Provide the acquired Client ID and Client Secret under Settings of the app and save it.

#### GetResponse Single Webhook URL
If you wish to create an orchestration where a workflow is being triggered when some operation occurs in GetResponse, you'd need to subscribe to GetResponse's Webhook. Cobalt provides
a single webhook URL to manage such event triggers for all your customers.

**To setup GetResponse webhook subscription:**

1. Select **GetResponse** from the application list in **Cobalt** > select `Settings` and copy the `Single Webhook Url` .
2. Navigate to `Tools` > `Webhooks` in GetResponse platform and click on `Create Webhook`.
3. Provide a `Webhook name` > Paste the **Single Webhook Url** inside the `Webhook URL` field > select the relevant events in `Which event to notify you of?` > Change `Status` toggle to **Active** and click on `Create webhook`.
