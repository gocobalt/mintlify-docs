#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Provide the acquired Client Id and Client secret under Settings of the app and save it.

#### Help Scout Single Webhook URL
If you wish to create an orchestration where a workflow is being triggered when some operation occurs in Help Scout, you'd need to subscribe to Help Scout's Webhook. Cobalt provides
a single webhook URL to manage such event triggers for all your customers.

**To setup Help Scout webhook subscription:**
1. Select **HelpScout** from the application list in **Cobalt**, and select `Settings`.
2. Copy the `Single Webhook Url`
3. Go to `Manage` in the top nav bar > Select `Apps` > `Webhooks` in your Help Scout account.
4. Click on `Install App`
5. Provide the `Secret Key` as ** ** > Paste the **Single Webhook Url** in `Callback URL` > Toggle on for **Active** > Select the Events and click on `Save`.
<Note>
Ensure that the Secret key entered is ``. No other value will be able to verify the Webhook.
