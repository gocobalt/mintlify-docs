## Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting `Use our credentials`. However, if you wish to use your own application,
select `Use your own credentials`. Provide the aquired Client Id and Client secret and save it.

## Publishing Clover App

Clover requires a Production level account and a Production OAuth app for use in real-time use. This requires an approval from the Clover team for the account and app.

#### 1. Submit your Production Developer account for approval

Clover must verify and approve your production developer account before starting the process to approve your app.

- Log in to the production Developer Dashboard. The Developer Dashboard appears.

- From the left navigation menu, click `Developer Settings` > `Info`. The Developer Info page appears.
- Click the edit icon in each section, enter developer information, and click `Save`.
- Click the **Developer Agreement link** to review the Clover App Market Developer Terms.
- Click `Verify Your Account`. You agree to the Clover App Market Developer Terms by submitting your details.

Learn more about the Production Developer Account approval process [here](https://docs.clover.com/docs/developer-account-approval).

#### 2. Submit your app for approval

To integrate your point of sale (POS) with a production Clover device, you need to create a Clover app that merchants can install.
