#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Provide the acquired Client ID and Client Secret under Settings of the app and save it.

#### Configuring Scopes
Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under `Permissions & Scopes`
section. 

For some applications Cobalt sets **mandatory scopes** which cannot be removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any 
custom scopes supported by the respective platform.

Once the scopes has been added to the application in Cobalt, the app will now request for access of the mentioned scopes.

<Warning>
If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform.
</Warning>

#### App Approval for Etsy

Once the app is created in Etsy, it needs to be approved by the Etsy team before it can be used for OAuth.

If the keys are not approved in 3-4 Business days, you can contact the Etsy Developer team at developers@etsy.com describing your **use-case**, **App name** and the **Keystring** of the App to be approved.

The app will be approved for `Personal Access` and since the app is only going to be used by a handful of Etsy members, then Commercial Access may not be required. Instead, these members can be added on as provisional users.
<Tip>
Learn how to add provisional users to your app [here](https://groups.google.com/g/etsy-api-v2/c/_TA7DrM2uSU/m/rSs2INR9orQJ).
