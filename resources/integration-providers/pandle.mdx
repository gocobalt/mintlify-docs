To setup your Pandle app in Cobalt for OAuth, you will need the following credentials from your [Pandle account](https://my.pandle.com/users/sign_in):
- Client ID
- Client Secret


<Info>If you haven't already created an app in Pandle, you'd need to create one.</Info>

### Creating an app in Pandle

Currently Pandle doesn’t support online registrations, so you’ll need to send an email to support@pandle.com that includes the following details:
- **App name**: A short name for your app. Your customers will see this when they authorize your connection to their data.
- **Description**: A short description of what your app does.
- **Re-direct URI**: Go to your [`Apps catalog`](https://app.gocobalt.io/apps) in **Cobalt** > Search for `Pandle` > `Settings` > `Use your credentials` > `Callback Url` > Copy it. Provide this URL to Pandle support in the mail.

Pandle will issue secure keys to you, including a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. It may take a number of working days to receive these details.

#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting `Use our credentials`. However, if you wish to use your own application,
select `Use your own credentials`. Provide the aquired **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and save it.


#### Actions and triggers
Once the above setup is completed, you can create orchestrations of your use-cases using Pandle actions and triggers. Following are the set of Pandle actions and triggers
