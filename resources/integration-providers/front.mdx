Cobalt offers both **Key Based** and **OAuth 2.0** integration for Front. In this guide, we will look at the OAuth App setup process.

To setup your Front app in Cobalt for OAuth, you will need the following credentials from your [Front Developer account](https://app.frontapp.com/settings/developers):
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- App Secret

### Pre-requisites

1. Front account. You can create one [here](https://front.com/signup).


<Info>If you haven't already created an app in Front, you'd need to create one.</Info>

#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting `Use our credentials`. However, if you wish to use your own application,
select `Use your own credentials`. Provide the acquired Client Id, Client secret and App secret and save it.


#### Front Single Webhook URL
If you wish to create an orchestration where a workflow is being triggered when some operation occurs in Front, you'd need to subscribe to Front's Webhook. Cobalt provides
a single webhook URL to manage such event triggers for all your customers.

**To setup Front webhook subscription:**

1. Select **Front** from the application list in **Cobalt**, and select `Settings`.
2. Provide the `Client ID`, `Client Secret` and `App Secret` > Copy the `Single Webhook Url` and click on `Save`.
<Info>
Front Webhooks required App secret for verification and registration of Webhooks.
</Info>
3. Select your OAuth app > Go to `Features` tab > Select `Webhook` in your [Front Developer Dashboard](https://app.frontapp.com/settings/developers) > Click on `Create Webhook`.
4. Paste the **Single Webhook Url** inside the `Webhook URL` section, select the relevant events in `Subscribed events` dropdown and click on `Create`.

#### Making Front App Public

To make the Front app available to all the users outside your organization, the app needs to go through a review process.

To submit your app for review, fill out the form provided by Front [here](https://airtable.com/shrYbZrIP3g4YXi8M).
