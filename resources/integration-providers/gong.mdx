3. Click on `Create Integration` button under the `Integrations` tab.
4. Go to your [`Apps catalog`](https://app.gocobalt.io/apps) in **Cobalt** > Search for `Gong` > `Settings` > `Use your credentials` > `Callback Url` > Copy it.
5. In the app, enter the `Name` and `Description` of the app, upload a `Logo` and an `Icon` for your integration, paste the Callback Url under `Redirect URI Needed for the OAuth Authorization Code Flow` field and complete the other required fields.

#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Provide the acquired Client Id and Client secret under Settings of the app and save it.

#### Configuring Scopes
Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under `Permissions & Scopes`
section. 

For some applications Cobalt sets **mandatory scopes** which cannot be removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any 
custom scopes supported by the respective platform.

Once the scopes has been added to the application in Cobalt, go to your [Gong Developer Hub](https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#overview) and update the scopes as added on Cobalt.

Select the OAuth App created for Cobalt > Click on `Edit` option of the app > Add the scopes as added in Cobalt > Click on `Save`. 

<Warning>
If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform. And, the scopes selected here are
identical to the ones selected in the platform.
</Warning>

#### Publishing Gong App
While you're creating your app, the app is set to **Private** by default, and can only be used by you in your Gong account. For the app to authenticate with your users, the app needs to be published.
