<Info>If you haven't already created an app in Salesloft, you'd need to create one.</Info>

### Creating an app in Salesloft

To create a Salesloft app and acquire the above mentioned credentials, please follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Log in to your [Salesloft Developer account](https://developers.salesloft.com/).
2. Click on the `Manage Apps` button in the top nav bar.

3. Click on `Create New` button in **OAuth Applications**.
4. Go to your [`Apps catalog`](https://app.gocobalt.io/apps) in **Cobalt** > Search for `Salesloft` > `Settings` > `Use your credentials` > `Callback Url` > Copy it.
5. Give the app `Name` > Paste the Callback Url copied under `Redirect URL` field > Select `Application Type` as **Public application** > Select the required **Scopes** and click on `Save`. 
<Note>
Appl type is selected as Public Application to ensure people outside your organization can authenticate with it as well.
</Note>

6. Copy the `Application ID` **(Client ID)** and `Secret`**(Client Secret)** displayed on the screen.

#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Provide the acquired Client ID and Client Secret under Settings of the app and save it.

#### Configuring Scopes
Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under `Permissions & Scopes`
section. 

For some applications Cobalt sets **mandatory scopes** which cannot be removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any 
custom scopes supported by the respective platform.

Once the scopes has been added to the application in Cobalt, go to your [Salesloft Developer account](https://developers.salesloft.com/) and update the scopes as added on Cobalt.

Select the OAuth App created for Cobalt and click on `Edit` for it > Add the scopes under `Scopes` as added in Cobalt > Click on `Submit`. 

<Warning>
If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform. And, the scopes selected here are
identical to the ones selected in the platform.
</Warning>

#### Getting Production Credentials of App

Once you've built your app using OAuth Authenication, you must submit it to be reviewed for allowlisting so that it can be used by other Salesloft instances.
