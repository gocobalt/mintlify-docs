- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Scopes

1. offline access

<Info>If you haven't already created an app in Dialpad, you'd need to create one.</Info>

### Creating an app in Dialpad

Currently Dialpad doesn’t support app registrations through platform, so you’ll need to fill the following [form](https://airtable.com/appROW6mZJwsnGidA/shrju5b3Sqebrmn96) to request an OAuth app that includes the following details:
- **App name**: A short name for your app. Your customers will see this when they authorize your connection to their data.
- **Deverloper Name and Email**: The email which will receive updates about the app.
- **Developer Type**: Choose `Independent Software Vendor' if none of the other fits.
- **App Type**: Select `App Type` as **This App is for my customers..**
- **App Description**: Provide the description of what your product does and the features of Dialpad integration on your platform.
- **App Environment**: Select app environment based on your usecase. Recommened option is `Both`.
- **Scopes**: Provide the mandatory scopes and additional scopes required by you in the app.
- **Redirect URIs**: Go to your [`Apps catalog`](https://app.gocobalt.io/apps) in **Cobalt** > Search for `Dialpad` > `Settings` > `Use your credentials` > `Callback Url` > Copy it. Provide this URL to Dialpad in the form.

Dialpad will issue secure keys to you, including a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. It may take a number of working days to receive these details.

#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting `Use our credentials`. However, if you wish to use your own application,
select `Use your own credentials`. Provide the aquired Client Id and Client secret and save it.

#### Configuring Scopes
Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under `Permissions & Scopes`
section. 

For some applications Cobalt sets **mandatory scopes** which cannot be removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any 
custom scopes supported by the respective platform.

Once the scopes has been added to the application in Cobalt, the app will now request for access of the mentioned scopes.

<Warning>
If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform.
</Warning>

#### Actions and triggers
Once the above setup is completed, you can create orchestrations of your use-cases using Dialpad actions and triggers. Following are the set of Dialpad actions and triggers
