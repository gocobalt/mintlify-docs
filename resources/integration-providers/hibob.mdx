## Permissions for Service User

By default, Service Users in HiBob are created with no access permissions/scopes and need to be added in a permission group with the relevant permissions. You need to create a specific permissions group for Service Users and add the service user to that group.

#### Create Permission group

1. Go to `Settings` > `Account` > `Permission Groups` in your HiBob account.
2. Click on `+ Add Permission Group` > Provide a **Group Name** > Select `Select people by condition` in **Group members** > Click `Select People`.
3. Delete the default Conditions given > Click on `Add Specific Employees` > `Service Users` > Select the Service Users > Click on `Apply` > Click `Create`.

#### Permissions in the Group
1. In the Group, under **Features** tab, go to `API Access` and enable **Manage REST API Token** > Click on `Save` > Click on `Apply`.
2. Also add other permissions which are required based on your Actions requirements.
