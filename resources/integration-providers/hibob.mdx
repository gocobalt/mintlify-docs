## Permissions for Service User

By default, Service Users in HiBob are created with no access permissions/scopes and need to be added in a permission group with the relevant permissions. You need to create a specific permissions group for Service Users and add the service user to that group.

#### Create Permission group

1. Go to `Settings` \> `Account` \> `Permission Groups` in your HiBob account.
2. Click on `+ Add Permission Group` \> Provide a **Group Name** \> Select `Select people by condition` in **Group members** \> Click `Select People`.
3. Delete the default Conditions given \> Click on `Add Specific Employees` \> `Service Users` \> Select the Service Users \> Click on `Apply` \> Click `Create`.

#### Permissions in the Group

1. In the Group, under **Features** tab, go to `API Access` and enable **Manage REST API Token** \> Click on `Save` \> Click on `Apply`.
2. Also add other permissions which are required based on your Actions requirements.
