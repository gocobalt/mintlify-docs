#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth 2.0` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting `Use our credentials`. However, if you wish to use your own application,
select `Use your own credentials`. Provide the aquired Client Id and Client secret and save it.

<Tip>
To get access to your Production Credentials for Gusto App, you need to submit app for review to Gusto. Learn more about the Review and it's requirements [here](https://docs.gusto.com/app-integrations/docs/introduction#review).
