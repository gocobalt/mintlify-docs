<Warning>
Client Secret and Webhook signing key will be visible only once, so make ensure that they are copied and saved somewhere for future reference.

#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth2` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.
