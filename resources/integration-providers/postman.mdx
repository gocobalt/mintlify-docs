3. Click on `Generate API Key` button in the API Keys section.
4. Enter a name for your API key (e.g., "Refold Integration") to help you identify it later.
5. Click `Generate API Key` button to create the key.
6. Go to your [`Apps catalog`](https://app.refold.ai/apps) in **Refold** \> Search for `Postman` \> `Settings` \> `Use your credentials` \> Copy the configuration endpoint if needed.
7. Copy the generated API key immediately as it will only be shown once.

#### Configuring credentials in Refold

App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `API Key` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data, they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

  alt="Setting up application credentials"
/>

Provide the acquired API Key under Settings of the app and save it.

#### Configuring Permissions

Refold lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. For Postman API Key authentication, the API key has full access to all resources in the workspace.

<Warning>
  If you are facing authentication errors, make sure your API key is valid and has not been revoked. API keys provide full access to your Postman workspace resources.
</Warning>

#### Actions and triggers

Once the above setup is completed, you can create orchestrations of your use-cases using Postman actions and triggers. Following are the set of Postman actions and triggers supported by Refold.
