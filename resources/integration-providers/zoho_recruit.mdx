<img height="200" src="/images/Zohocrm/Zohocrm_credentials.png" alt="Getting Credentials"/>

## Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth2` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

<img height="200" src="/images/Zoho_recruit/ZohoRecruit_cobalt.png" alt="Setting up application client credentials"/>

Provide the acquired Client ID and Client Secret under Settings of the app and save it.

## Configuring Scopes
Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under `Permissions & Scopes`
section. 

For some applications Cobalt sets mandatory scopes which cannot be removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any 
custom scopes supported by the respective platform.
<img height="200" src="/images/Zoho_recruit/ZohoRecruit_scopes.png" alt="OAuth Scopes"/>

Once the scopes has been added to the application in Cobalt, the app will now request for access of the mentioned scopes.

<Warning>
If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform.
</Warning>

## Zoho Recruit Single Webhook URL
If you wish to create an orchestration where a workflow is being triggered when some operation occurs in Zoho Recruit, you'd need to create a Zoho Recruit's Webhook and add it as a Rule. 

Cobalt provides a single webhook URL to manage such event triggers. The steps given below needs to be followed by all of your customers to setup webhooks in their account.

Let's setup the **Candidate Status changed** webhook in Zoho Recruit. For this you need to do two steps:

#### 1. Create Webhook Action

1. Select **Zoho Recruit** from the application list in **Cobalt** > select `Settings` and copy the `Single Webhook URL`.
2. In Zoho Recruit, click on `Setup`(Gear icon) in the top bar and select `Actions` present under **Automation**.
<Note>
Your customers' accounts should be on Zoho Recruit Standard or a higher plan to use webhooks.
</Note>
<img height="200" src="/images/Zoho_recruit/Zohorecruit_webhook.png" alt="Setting up Zoho Recruit Webhook Action"/>
3. Switch to the `Webhooks` tab and click on `Configure Webhook`.
4. Provide a **Name** > Paste the `Single Webhook URL` that you copied under **URL to Notify** and select the **Module** as `Candidates`.
5. Under `Append Entity Parameters`, go to **Parameters in the User Defined Format**, give the `Parameter Name` as **data** and copy the JSON provided below in `Value Description` field.

5. Under `Append Custom Parameters`, you need to add two parameters:
- First parameter name is `event` whose value will be `candidate_state_changed`.
<Info>The value of event will change based on the trigger that you are trying to setup.</Info>
- Second parameter name is `identifier` whose value will be the email id of Zoho Recruit account that is being used.

6. Click on `Save` to add the webhook.

#### 2. Create Workflow Rule in Zoho Recruit

Once the user has created a webhook, they now need to add it as a Rule in Recruit so that it fires Cobalt event.

1. Navigate to `Workflow Rules` under **Automation** and click on `+ Create Rule` button.
2. Select **Module** as `Candidates`, add a **Rule Name** and click on `Next`.
3. In the Rule, select `On a record action` > Choose `Candidate Stage` radio button for the Candidate Status Changed trigger and click on `Next`.
<Tip>
Based on the trigger that you are using, you would select different action. For example in Candidate Created, you would choose the `Create` radio button.
</Tip>
4. Select `All Candidates` as the **Condition 1** and click on `Next`.
5. Select `Instant Actions` and click on `Webhooks`. Select the Webhook that you created and click on `Associate`.
