#### Configuring credentials in Cobalt
App settings page lets you configure the authentication settings for an `OAuth2` based application. For your customers to provide you authorization to access their data,
they would first need to install your application. This page lets you set up your application credentials.

Cobalt lets you use pre-configured applications to play around. You can do so by selecting `Use our credentials`. However, if you wish to use your own application,
select `Use your own credentials`. Provide the acquired Client Id and Client secret and click on `Save changes`.

#### Configuring Scopes
Cobalt lets you configure what permissions to ask from your users while they install your application. The scopes can be added or removed from the App settings page, under `Permissions & Scopes`
section. 

For some applications Cobalt sets mandatory scopes which cannot be removed. Additional scopes can be selected from the drop down. Cobalt also has the provision to add any 
custom scopes supported by the respective platform.

Once the scopes has been added to the application in Cobalt, go to your [Jira Developer Portal](https://developer.atlassian.com/console) and update the scopes as added on Cobalt.

Select the OAuth App created for Cobalt > Click on `Permissions` in the left menu > Click `Configure` in **Jira API** > Click on `Edit Scopes` > Select the scope > Click on `Save` . 

<Warning>
If you are facing scopes missing or invalid scope error. Make sure you are not passing any custom scope not supported by the platform. And, the scopes selected here are
identical to the ones selected in the platform.
</Warning>

#### Jira Single Webhook URL
If you wish to create an orchestration where a workflow is being triggered when some operation occurs in Jira, you'd need to subscribe to Jira's Webhook. Cobalt provides
a single webhook URL to manage such event triggers for all your customers.

**To setup Jira webhook subscription:**

1. Select **Jira** from the application list in **Cobalt**, and select `Settings`.
2. Copy the `Single Webhook Url`.
3. In your **Jira Admin account**, click on `Gear` icon in the top right > Select `System` under Jira Settings.
<img height="200" src="/images/Jira/jira_system.png" alt="Jira Webhooks Registration"/>
4. Scroll down in the side menu and select `WebHooks`.


5. Click on `+ Create a WebHook`, give it a `Name`, paste the Webhook URL that you copied under `URL` and add relevant events for which you want to be notified.
<Note>
Make sure the WebHook created has the **Enabled** status.
