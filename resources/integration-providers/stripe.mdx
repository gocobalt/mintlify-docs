4. The **Secret key** is your API Key that will be used for server-side API calls. Click on `Reveal test key` or `Reveal live key` based on your environment.
5. Click on `Create secret key` button if you need to generate a new secret key for enhanced security.
7. Copy the **Secret key** from the Stripe dashboard. You can also set a name for your key to identify it later.

#### Test Mode vs Live Mode

Stripe provides separate API keys for test mode and live mode:

- **Test Mode Keys**: Use these for development and testing. Test mode keys start with `sk_test_`.
- **Live Mode Keys**: Use these for production. Live mode keys start with `sk_live_`.

Make sure to use the appropriate key based on your environment. Refold supports both test and live mode configurations.

## Actions and triggers

Once the above setup is completed, you can create orchestrations of your use-cases using Stripe actions and triggers. Following are the set of Stripe actions and triggers supported by Refold.
