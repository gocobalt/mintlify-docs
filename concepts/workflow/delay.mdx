title: Delay Node
---
The Delay node in Cobalt allows users to introduce delays in workflow execution for a specific time period. By adding a Delay node to the workflow, users can control the timing of subsequent actions, enabling precise orchestration of workflows.

## Delay Node Actions
The Delay node offers two types of actions:

### Wait for

Specifies that the workflow should wait for the specified duration before proceeding.

### Wait till 

Specifies that the workflow should wait until the specified time period is reached before proceeding. Wait Till has 2 additional Input fields, `Before or After Base Date` and the `Base Date` field.

## Steps to Use Delay Node
To incorporate a Delay node into a workflow, follow these steps:

### Create Workflow 

Begin by navigating to the respective app and creating a new workflow. Add an event and publish the workflow to activate it.

<Tip>Learn more about Workflows [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/guides/workflow/overview).</Tip>

### Add Delay Node 

Within the workflow, add a Delay node as per your requirement along with other nodes to define the workflow flow.

### Configure Delay Action 

In the Delay node, select the action type as either **Wait for** or **Wait till** depending on the desired behavior. Specify the duration of the delay by entering the desired values for **Days**, **Hours**, **Minutes**, and **Seconds**. By default, the values will be set as 0 for all the input fields.
<Note>
Currently Cobalt supports only integral values for the Input fields in Delay Node.

### Define Node Rule Condition 

Optionally, add **Node Rule Conditions** to the Delay node to specify conditions under which the delay will be applied. Configure the conditions using the same approach as a Rule node, specifying **variables**, **operators**, and **values**.

These conditions can be configured to match any conditions or match all conditions, depending on the workflow requirements.

## Workflow Execution with Delay Node
During workflow execution, the Delay node introduces a pause in execution for the specified time period before proceeding to the next action.

If the rule condition specified for the Delay node is met, the workflow will execute as per the defined delay duration.

If the rule condition is not met, the Delay node will be skipped, and the workflow will proceed without delay.



By leveraging the Delay node in Cobalt, users can introduce precise timing controls into their workflows, enabling efficient orchestration and execution of automated processes.
