## What does it do?

The Merge Node waits for specified upstream branches to complete, fail, or be skipped before proceeding with the workflow. It's essential for workflows that split into parallel paths and need to reconvene later to process combined results.

**Common use cases:**
- Combining results from multiple nodes
- Synchronizing data from multiple API calls
- Waiting for parallel processing tasks to complete
- Coordinating multi-step data validation workflows

## Actions

<ResponseField name="Action Name" type="string">
  <Expandable title="Available Actions">
    <ResponseField name="`Merge All`" type="action">
      Waits for all upstream branches to complete before proceeding.
      
      **Behavior:**
      - Waits for every upstream branch to reach terminal status
      - Use when all parallel operations are equally important
      - Safest option for data consistency
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="`Merge Conditional`" type="action">
      Waits only for user-specified mandatory branches to complete.
      
      **Behavior:**
      - Waits only for specified mandatory branches
      - Non-mandatory branches can fail without blocking workflow
      - Use when some operations are optional or non-critical
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

## Input Parameters

<ParamField path="Mandatory Branches" type="checkbox list" required="conditional">
  Available only when using `Merge Conditional` action. Select which branches must complete before the merge proceeds. Example: `["data_validation", "security_check"]`
</ParamField>

<Callout type="info">
**Note**: The `Merge All` action requires no additional configuration. It automatically waits for all connected upstream branches to complete.
</Callout>

## Output

The Merge Node outputs a map containing results from all upstream branches, regardless of whether they completed successfully, failed, or were skipped.

### Output Structure

```json
{
  "branch_name_1": {
    "result": "Successful output data"
  },
  "branch_name_2": {
    "error": "Error message if branch failed"
  },
  "branch_name_3": {
    "skipped": true,
    "reason": "Condition not met"
  }
}
```

### Status Handling

- **Completed branches**: Include their full output under `result`
- **Failed branches**: Include error details under `error` 
- **Skipped branches**: Include `skipped: true` with skip reason

## Adding to Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Drag Merge Node to canvas">
    From the **Utility Nodes** section, drag the Merge Node to your workflow canvas and position it where parallel branches need to reconvene.
    
    <img height="200" src="/images/workflow/nodes/merge-node-drag-drop.png" alt="Dragging Merge Node from utility nodes"/>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select action">
    Click on the Merge Node to open configuration. Choose your merge strategy:
    - **Merge All**: Wait for every upstream branch to finish
    - **Merge Conditional**: Wait only for branches you specify as mandatory
    
    <img height="200" src="/images/workflow/nodes/merge-node-action-selection.png" alt="Selecting merge action in configuration"/>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure parameters for selected action">
    **For Merge All**: No additional configuration needed
    **For Merge Conditional**: Select which branches are mandatory for the merge to proceed
    
    <img height="200" src="/images/workflow/nodes/merge-node-parameter-configuration.png" alt="Configuring merge parameters"/>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run/Test Node">
    Test your merge configuration to verify it behaves as expected with your workflow branches.
    
    <img height="200" src="/images/workflow/nodes/merge-node-test-execution.png" alt="Testing merge node configuration"/>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** The Merge Node automatically detects all upstream branchesâ€”no manual configuration needed. Branch names are populated based on your workflow structure.
</Callout>

## Examples

### Example 1: Merge All Action

This example waits for both Salesforce contact creation and HubSpot contact sync to complete:

```javascript
// Workflow configuration
{
  "name": "merge_task",
  "taskReferenceName": "merge_contacts",
  "type": "MERGE",
  "action": "Merge All",
  "inputParameters": {}
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "salesforce_contact": {
    "result": {
      "id": "003xx000002ABC",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com"
    }
  },
  "hubspot_sync": {
    "result": {
      "vid": 12345,
      "status": "synced"
    }
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Merge Conditional Action

This example waits only for critical data validation while allowing optional enrichment to fail:

```javascript
// Workflow configuration  
{
  "name": "merge_task",
  "taskReferenceName": "merge_validation",
  "type": "MERGE",
  "action": "Merge Conditional", 
  "mandatory": ["data_validation", "security_check"],
  "inputParameters": {}
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "data_validation": {
    "result": { "valid": true, "score": 95 }
  },
  "security_check": {
    "result": { "passed": true, "risk_level": "low" }
  },
  "optional_enrichment": {
    "error": "Service temporarily unavailable"
  }
}
```

## Runtime Behavior

<Callout type="warning">
**Important**: The Merge Node will wait indefinitely for required branches to complete. Ensure your upstream nodes have proper timeout and error handling configured.
</Callout>

### Branch Status Requirements

The Merge Node proceeds when required branches reach one of these terminal states:

- **COMPLETED**: Branch finished successfully
- **ERROR**: Branch failed after all retry attempts  
- **SKIPPED_AND_COMPLETED**: Branch was skipped due to conditions

## Troubleshooting

### Merge Node Never Proceeds

**Problem**: Workflow hangs at Merge Node
**Solutions**: 
- Check if upstream branches have infinite loops or missing error handling
- Verify all connected branches can reach terminal states
- Review retry configurations for failing branches

### Missing Branch Data

**Problem**: Expected branch output not in merge results
**Solutions**:
- Confirm branch is properly connected to Merge Node
- Check branch status in workflow execution logs
- Verify branch naming matches expected output keys

### Conditional Merge Validation Error

**Problem**: "No mandatory branches selected" error in UI
**Solution**: Select at least one branch as mandatory when using `Merge Conditional` action

<Callout type="info">
**Tip**: Use the Debug Node after Merge to inspect the complete output structure and verify all expected branches are present.
</Callout>
