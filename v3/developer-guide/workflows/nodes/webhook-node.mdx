# Wait for Webhook Node

## What does it do?

The Wait for Webhook Node pauses workflow execution until an external system triggers a webhook by sending a POST request to the generated webhook URL. This enables asynchronous workflow coordination where the workflow waits for external processes to complete before continuing with subsequent steps.

**Common use cases:**
- Wait for third-party data enrichment services (Clearbit, ZoomInfo) to return Salesforce lead data
- Pause workflow for manual approval processes via external systems
- Coordinate with asynchronous external APIs that respond via webhooks
- Wait for external document processing or validation to complete
- Synchronize workflows with external business process completion

## Input Parameters

<ParamField path="Webhook URL" type="string" required="automatic">
  Automatically generated static webhook URL that external systems must call to resume workflow execution. Example: `https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v1/workflows/webhooks/6887`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Security Headers" type="object" required="optional">
  Optional key-value pairs for webhook authentication validation. If configured, incoming webhook requests must include these headers. Example: `{"Authorization": "Bearer secret123", "X-API-Key": "webhook-key"}`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Additional Fields" type="boolean" required="optional">
  Toggle to enable/disable additional configuration options. When disabled, removes the Security Headers field requirement.
</ParamField>

<Info>The webhook URL is automatically generated when the node is added and remains static. Only POST requests are supported. The webhook serves purely as a trigger mechanism and does not pass data to subsequent nodes.</Info>

## Output

The Wait for Webhook Node does not produce any output data for subsequent nodes. It serves purely as a workflow control mechanism.

### Execution States

- **Waiting**: Workflow paused at this node, waiting for webhook trigger
- **Triggered**: Webhook received, workflow continues to next nodes
- **Error**: Webhook request failed validation (missing security headers)

<Info>This node acts as a gate in your workflow - it either blocks execution (waiting) or allows it to continue (triggered), but doesn't transform or pass along any data.</Info>

## Adding to Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Drag Wait for Webhook Node to canvas">
    From the **Utility Nodes** section, drag the Wait for Webhook Node to your workflow canvas where you need to pause execution.

      <img height="200" src="/images/workflow/nodes/wait-webhook-node-drag-drop.png" alt="Dragging Wait for Webhook Node from utility nodes" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure security headers (optional)">
    Set up webhook authentication if needed:
    - Add key-value pairs for required headers
    - Leave empty `{}` if no authentication required
    - Headers must match exactly in incoming webhook requests
    <Frame>
      <img height="200" src="/images/workflow/nodes/wait-webhook-node-security-configuration.png" alt="Configuring webhook security headers" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy webhook URL">
    Copy the automatically generated webhook URL:
    - Share this URL with external systems that need to trigger the webhook
    - URL remains static and can be used multiple times
    - Only POST requests to this URL will trigger the workflow
    <Frame>
      <img height="200" src="/images/workflow/nodes/wait-webhook-node-url-display.png" alt="Copying webhook URL" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure external system">
    Set up the external system to call your webhook:
    - Configure POST request to the webhook URL
    - Include required security headers if configured
    - Set up timing for when the webhook should be triggered
    <Frame>
      <img height="200" src="/images/workflow/nodes/wait-webhook-external-setup.png" alt="Setting up external webhook caller" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test webhook trigger">
    Test the webhook integration to verify the workflow resumes correctly when triggered.
    <Frame>
      <img height="200" src="/images/workflow/nodes/wait-webhook-node-test-execution.png" alt="Testing webhook trigger" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>The workflow will remain paused at this node indefinitely until the webhook is triggered. Only the first webhook request will resume execution - subsequent requests are ignored.</Info>

## Examples

### Example 1: Salesforce Lead Enrichment Workflow

This example pauses a workflow while waiting for third-party lead enrichment data:

```javascript
// Workflow configuration
{
  "name": "wait_webhook_task",
  "taskReferenceName": "wait_for_enrichment",
  "type": "WAIT_FOR_WEBHOOK",
  "inputParameters": {
    "webhook_url": "https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v1/workflows/webhooks/6887",
    "security_headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer enrichment-secret-123",
      "X-Webhook-Source": "clearbit"
    }
  }
}
```

**Workflow Flow:**
1. **Trigger**: New Salesforce lead created
2. **HTTP Request Node**: Send lead email to Clearbit enrichment API
3. **Wait for Webhook**: Pause until Clearbit sends enrichment data via webhook
4. **Update Salesforce**: Continue with enriched lead data processing

**External Webhook Call (from Clearbit):**
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v1/workflows/webhooks/6887 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer enrichment-secret-123" \
  -H "X-Webhook-Source: clearbit" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Example 2: Manual Approval Process

This example waits for manual approval via an external approval system:

```javascript
// Workflow configuration  
{
  "name": "wait_webhook_task",
  "taskReferenceName": "wait_for_approval",
  "type": "WAIT_FOR_WEBHOOK",
  "inputParameters": {
    "webhook_url": "https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v1/workflows/webhooks/7234",
    "security_headers": {
      "X-Approval-System": "internal",
      "X-Request-ID": "{{approval_request.id}}"
    }
  }
}
```

**Workflow Flow:**
1. **Salesforce Opportunity**: High-value opportunity created
2. **Send Approval Request**: Notify approval system via email/Slack
3. **Wait for Webhook**: Pause until approval decision received
4. **Process Approval**: Continue with approved opportunity workflow

### Example 3: Simple Webhook Without Security

This example demonstrates a basic webhook wait without authentication:

```javascript
// Workflow configuration
{
  "name": "wait_webhook_task", 
  "taskReferenceName": "simple_webhook_wait",
  "type": "WAIT_FOR_WEBHOOK",
  "inputParameters": {
    "webhook_url": "https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v1/workflows/webhooks/8456",
    "security_headers": {}
  }
}
```

**External Webhook Call:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v1/workflows/webhooks/8456 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Runtime Behavior

<Warning>Workflows will remain paused indefinitely at the Wait for Webhook Node until the webhook is triggered. Ensure external systems are properly configured to send the webhook request.</Warning>

### Webhook Processing

The Wait for Webhook Node processes incoming requests in the following order:

1. **Request Validation**: Validates POST method and URL match
2. **Security Header Check**: Verifies required headers if configured
3. **Workflow Resume**: Triggers continuation of workflow execution
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Ignores subsequent webhook requests for the same execution

### Security Validation

When security headers are configured:
- **Required Headers**: All configured headers must be present in the webhook request
- **Exact Match**: Header values must match exactly (case-sensitive)
- **Missing Headers**: Returns `missing_security_headers` error to webhook caller
- **Workflow Continuation**: Only resumes workflow if all security requirements met

### Multiple Request Handling

- **First Request**: Resumes workflow execution if validation passes
- **Subsequent Requests**: Ignored, do not affect workflow state
- **Error Requests**: Failed validation attempts do not prevent valid requests from working

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Stuck at Webhook Node

**Problem**: Workflow remains paused indefinitely at Wait for Webhook Node

**Solutions**:
- Verify external system is configured to call the correct webhook URL
- Check that external system is using POST method
- Confirm external system includes required security headers if configured
- Test webhook URL manually with curl or API testing tool

### Security Header Validation Errors

**Problem**: Webhook requests fail with `missing_security_headers` error

**Solutions**:
- Verify all configured security headers are included in webhook request
- Check header names and values match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure external system is sending headers in correct format
- Test with empty security headers `{}` to isolate authentication issues

### External System Integration Issues

**Problem**: External system cannot trigger webhook or receives errors

**Solutions**:
- Confirm external system supports POST requests to webhook URLs
- Verify external system can access Cobalt webhook endpoints (no firewall blocks)
- Check external system timeout settings allow for webhook delivery
- Implement retry logic in external system for webhook delivery

### Webhook URL Not Working

**Problem**: Webhook URL returns 404 or other HTTP errors

**Solutions**:
- Verify webhook URL is copied correctly without truncation
- Ensure workflow with Wait for Webhook Node is deployed and active
- Check that workflow execution has reached the Wait for Webhook Node
- Confirm webhook URL has not been regenerated by modifying the node

<Tip>Use webhook testing tools like curl, Postman, or online webhook testers to verify your webhook URL and security headers work correctly before integrating with external systems.</Tip>
