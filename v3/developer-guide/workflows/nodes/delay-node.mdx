# Delay Node

## What does it do?

The Delay Node allows you to pause workflow execution for a specific time period or until a target date and time. This gives you precise control over when subsequent actions occur in your workflow.

**Common use cases:**
- Wait 24 hours before sending follow-up emails to new Salesforce contacts
- Delay sync operations until specific business hours
- Space out API calls to avoid rate limiting
- Schedule workflows to run at optimal times
- Create cooling-off periods between automated actions

## Actions

<ResponseField name="Action Name" type="string">
  <Expandable title="Available Actions">
    <ResponseField name="`Wait For`" type="action">
      Pauses workflow execution for a specified duration from the current time.
      
      **Behavior:**
      - Adds delay relative to current execution time
      - Use for fixed waiting periods
      - Simple duration-based delays
      - Best for consistent timing requirements
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="`Wait Till`" type="action">
      Pauses workflow execution until a specific date and time is reached.
      
      **Behavior:**
      - Calculates delay based on target datetime
      - Can wait before or after a base date
      - Use for scheduled execution at specific times
      - Best for time-sensitive operations
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

### Output Structure

```json
{
  "delay_started_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "delay_duration": {
    "days": 1,
    "hours": 2, 
    "minutes": 30,
    "seconds": 0
  },
  "delay_until": "2024-01-16T13:00:00Z",
  "action_type": "Wait For",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

### Status Types

- **waiting**: Delay is currently active, workflow paused
- **completed**: Delay period finished, workflow continuing
- **skipped**: Delay was bypassed due to conditions
- **error**: Invalid delay configuration or calculation failure

## Adding to Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Drag Delay Node to canvas">
    From the **Utility Nodes** section, drag the Delay Node to your workflow canvas where you need to pause execution.
    
    <img height="200" src="/images/workflow/nodes/delay-node-drag-drop.png" alt="Dragging Delay Node from utility nodes"/>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select delay action">
    Click on the Delay Node to open configuration. Choose your delay strategy:
    - **Wait For**: Pause for a specific duration from now
    - **Wait Till**: Pause until a target date/time
    
    <img height="200" src="/images/workflow/nodes/delay-node-action-selection.png" alt="Selecting delay action type"/>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure delay parameters">
    Set your delay timing:
    - **For Wait For**: Specify days, hours, minutes, seconds
    - **For Wait Till**: Set base date and before/after timing
    
    <img height="200" src="/images/workflow/nodes/delay-node-parameter-configuration.png" alt="Configuring delay timing parameters"/>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run/Test Node">
    Test your delay configuration to verify timing calculations work as expected.
    
    <img height="200" src="/images/workflow/nodes/delay-node-test-execution.png" alt="Testing delay node configuration"/>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
**Note**: During delay periods, the workflow will show as "running" but paused. You can monitor delay status in the workflow execution logs.
</Callout>

## Examples

### Example 1: Wait For Action (Follow-up Delay)

This example waits 24 hours before sending a follow-up email to a new Salesforce contact:

```javascript
// Workflow configuration
{
  "name": "delay_task",
  "taskReferenceName": "followup_delay", 
  "type": "DELAY",
  "action": "Wait For",
  "inputParameters": {
    "days": 1,
    "hours": 0,
    "minutes": 0, 
    "seconds": 0
  }
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "delay_started_at": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
  "delay_duration": {
    "days": 1,
    "hours": 0,
    "minutes": 0,
    "seconds": 0
  },
  "delay_until": "2024-01-16T14:30:00Z",
  "action_type": "Wait For",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

### Example 2: Wait Till Action (Business Hours Sync)

This example delays Salesforce sync until 9 AM the next business day:

```javascript
// Workflow configuration
{
  "name": "delay_task",
  "taskReferenceName": "business_hours_delay",
  "type": "DELAY", 
  "action": "Wait Till",
  "inputParameters": {
    "days": 0,
    "hours": 9,
    "minutes": 0,
    "seconds": 0,
    "beforeAfter": "After",
    "baseDate": "{{event.next_business_day}}"
  }
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "delay_started_at": "2024-01-15T16:45:00Z",
  "delay_duration": {
    "calculated_wait": "16 hours 15 minutes"
  },
  "delay_until": "2024-01-16T09:00:00Z", 
  "action_type": "Wait Till",
  "base_date": "2024-01-16T00:00:00Z",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

## Runtime Behavior

<Callout type="warning">
**Important**: Workflows with active delays will continue running and consuming resources. Maximum delay period is 30 days. All times are calculated in UTC timezone.
</Callout>

### Delay Calculation

The Delay Node calculates wait times as follows:

1. **Wait For**: Adds specified duration to current execution time
2. **Wait Till**: Calculates difference between current time and target datetime
3. **Validation**: Ensures delay doesn't exceed 30-day maximum
4. **Execution**: Pauses workflow thread until target time reached

### Variable Resolution

All timing parameters support variables from previous nodes:
- **Static values**: `"days": 2`
- **Node variables**: `"hours": "{{salesforce_contact.priority_hours}}"`
- **Event data**: `"baseDate": "{{event.scheduled_date}}"`

## Troubleshooting

### Delay Never Completes

**Problem**: Workflow stuck in delay state indefinitely

**Solutions**: 
- Check that delay duration is reasonable (under 30 days)
- Verify base date is valid ISO format for Wait Till actions
- Ensure calculated target time is in the future
- Review workflow execution logs for delay calculation errors

### Invalid Date Format Error

**Problem**: "Invalid base date format" error in Wait Till action

**Solutions**:
- Use valid ISO 8601 format: `2024-01-15T09:00:00Z`
- Ensure date variables from previous nodes are properly formatted
- Test date format with Debug Node before Delay Node
- Add date transformation if needed

### Delay Duration Too Long

**Problem**: "Maximum delay exceeded" validation error

**Solutions**:
- Reduce total delay to under 30 days
- Break long delays into multiple shorter Delay Nodes
- Use Wait Till action with nearer target dates
- Check variable values don't create excessive delays

<Callout type="info">
**Tip**: Use the Debug Node before your Delay Node to inspect timing variables and verify calculations before the delay executes.
