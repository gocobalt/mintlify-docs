# Terminology

Understanding key terms and concepts will help you navigate the Cobalt platform effectively.

## Core Concepts

### Application
A third-party service or platform that you want to integrate with (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack).

### Integration
The connection between your application and a third-party service, configured with authentication and data mapping.

### Linked Account
A representation of one of your end users within Cobalt's system, allowing them to connect their accounts to various applications.

### Workflow
A series of automated steps that define how data flows between your application and integrated services.

### Event
A trigger that initiates a workflow, such as a user action, data change, or scheduled task.

### Config Fields
Custom configuration options that allow end users to personalize their integration experience.

### API Proxy
A feature that allows you to make API calls to integrated services through Cobalt's infrastructure.

### Webhook
A mechanism for receiving real-time notifications when events occur in integrated applications.

## Authentication Terms

### OAuth
An authorization framework that allows applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on third-party services.

### API Key
A unique identifier used to authenticate requests to the Cobalt API.

### Session Token
A temporary token used to authenticate end users in embedded integration flows.

### Connected App
A configuration in third-party services (like Salesforce) that defines OAuth settings and permissions.

## Workflow Terms

### Node
An individual step in a workflow that performs a specific action (e.g., HTTP request, data transformation).

### Trigger
The starting point of a workflow that defines when the workflow should execute.

### Variable
A placeholder for dynamic data that can be used throughout workflows.

### Execution
A single run of a workflow, including all its steps and their results.

## Data Terms

### Field Mapping
The process of defining how data fields from one system correspond to fields in another system.

### Data Transformation
The process of converting data from one format to another during integration.

### Bulk Operations
Operations that handle large amounts of data efficiently, typically used for initial data synchronization.

### Real-time Sync
Continuous synchronization of data between systems as changes occur.
