Get up and running with Cobalt in under 10 minutes. You'll test a complete integration workflow and see real data flowing between applications.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- âœ… Tested a live integration workflow
- âœ… Seen data sync between your app and a third-party platform
- âœ… Understanding of how Cobalt's core components work together

<Info>
**Before you start**: You'll need a Cobalt account. [Sign up here](https://app.gocobalt.io/) if you haven't already.

</Step>

<Step title="Pick an Integration">
Choose any integration you have credentials for (HubSpot, Salesforce, Slack, etc.). For this guide, we'll use **HubSpot** as an example.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Configure Integration Credentials

You need to authenticate with the third-party app to test data flow.

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Authentication Type">
Go to **Apps** â†’ [Your Integration] â†’ **Settings**. You'll see either:
- **OAuth 2.0**: Requires app credentials (Client ID, Secret)
- **Key-based**: Requires API keys

<img height="200" src="/images/quickstart/auth-type-settings.png" alt="Integration settings showing authentication type" />
</Step>

<Step title="Set Up Credentials">

<Tabs>
<Tab title="OAuth 2.0 (Recommended)">
```text
1. Click "Use Our Credentials" for quick testing
   OR
2. Click "Read Documentation" to set up your own app
3. Add Client ID and Client Secret in Settings
4. Click Save
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Key-based">
```text
1. Click "Read Documentation" to get API keys
2. Follow the setup guide for your integration
3. Add API Key and other credentials in Settings
4. Click Save
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<img height="250" src="/images/quickstart/oauth-credentials-setup.png" alt="OAuth credentials configuration in app settings" />
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Quick tip**: Use "Our Credentials" for testing. You can switch to your own credentials later for production.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Set Up Response Testing

Configure where you'll receive the workflow response to see the integration working.

<Steps>
<Step title="Get Your Test URL">
1. Go to [webhook.site](https://webhook.site)
2. Copy **Your unique URL** (looks like: `https://webhook.site/abc123...`)

<img height="200" src="/images/quickstart/webhook-site-url.png" alt="Webhook.site showing unique URL for testing" />
</Step>

<Step title="Find the API Proxy">
1. In your chosen workflow, look for the **Native node** at the end
2. Note the **Action name** (e.g., "Create Contact", "Send Message")

<img height="250" src="/images/quickstart/workflow-native-node.png" alt="Workflow showing native node with API proxy action" />
</Step>

<Step title="Configure the Proxy">
1. Go to **Developers** â†’ **API Proxies**
2. Search for your Action name
3. Click on it and select **API Call** tab
4. Paste your webhook.site URL in **Request URL**
5. Click **Save API Call**

<img height="300" src="/images/quickstart/api-proxy-configuration.png" alt="API Proxy configuration with webhook URL setup" />
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Connect a Test User

Create a linked account to represent your end user and authenticate them.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Linked Account">
1. Go to **Linked Accounts** â†’ **+ Add Account**
2. Enter a test name (e.g., "Test User")
3. Click **Create**

<img height="200" src="/images/quickstart/create-linked-account.png" alt="Creating a new linked account" />
</Step>

<Step title="Generate Hosted URL">
1. Open your test linked account
2. Click **Get Hosted URL** â†’ **Generate Hosted URL**
3. Copy the URL and open it in a new tab

<img height="250" src="/images/quickstart/generate-hosted-url.png" alt="Generating hosted URL for linked account" />
</Step>

<Step title="Connect Integration">
1. In the hosted portal, find your integration
2. Click **Connect** and complete authentication
3. Enable the workflow you want to test
4. Click **Save**

<img height="300" src="/images/quickstart/hosted-portal-connect.png" alt="Hosted portal showing integration connection interface" />
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
The **Hosted Portal** is Cobalt's no-code authentication UI. Later, you can build your own UI using our SDKs.
</Info>

## Step 5: Test Your Integration

Now trigger the workflow and watch data flow.

<Steps>
<Step title="Trigger the Workflow">

**For Event-Based Workflows:**
1. Go to **Try API** in Cobalt
2. Select your event (e.g., "Contact Created")
3. Add test data:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "company": "Test Company"
}
```

4. Click **Fire Event**

<img height="300" src="/images/quickstart/try-api-fire-event.png" alt="Try API section with event firing interface" />

**For App-Based Triggers:**
Create a test record directly in your connected app (e.g., add a contact in HubSpot)
</Step>

<Step title="Check Execution">
1. Go to **Logs** in Cobalt
2. Find your workflow execution
3. Check the status and any error messages

<img height="250" src="/images/quickstart/execution-logs.png" alt="Workflow execution logs showing successful run" />
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Results">
1. Check your webhook.site for the API response
2. Verify data was created/updated in the target app
3. ðŸŽ‰ **Success!** You've completed your first integration test

<img height="200" src="/images/quickstart/webhook-response.png" alt="Webhook.site showing successful API response" />
</Step>
</Steps>

## See It in Action

Here's what just happened behind the scenes:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
// This is what Cobalt did when you fired the event
const response = await fetch('https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v2/public/event/contact-created', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    linked_account_id: 'your-linked-account-id',
    data: {
      name: 'John Doe',
      email: 'john@example.com',
      company: 'Test Company'
    }
  })
});

console.log('Workflow triggered:', response.status);
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v2/public/event/contact-created \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "linked_account_id": "your-linked-account-id",
    "data": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com", 
      "company": "Test Company"
    }
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<Warning>
**Common Issues:**

- **Authentication failed**: Double-check your credentials in App Settings
- **Workflow not triggering**: Ensure the workflow is enabled in the hosted portal
- **No response at webhook.site**: Verify the API Proxy URL is configured correctly
- **Missing scopes**: Add required permissions in App Settings â†’ Permissions & Scopes
</Warning>
