## API Access Management

### API Keys

Users with appropriate permissions can generate and manage API keys for programmatic access to the Cobalt platform.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
// Initialize Cobalt SDK with user-specific API key
const { CobaltSDK } = require('@cobalt-io/sdk');

const cobalt = new CobaltSDK({
  apiKey: process.env.COBALT_API_KEY,
  environment: 'production'
});
```

```python Python
from cobalt_sdk import CobaltSDK

# Initialize with user-specific API key
cobalt = CobaltSDK(
    api_key=os.getenv('COBALT_API_KEY'),
    environment='production'
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### API Key Management

- **Generation**: Users can generate multiple API keys for different purposes
- **Rotation**: Regular key rotation is recommended for security
- **Scoping**: Keys can be scoped to specific resources or actions
- **Monitoring**: API key usage is logged and can be monitored

## Security Best Practices

### Access Control

<Tip>
Follow the principle of least privilege - grant users only the minimum access required for their role.
</Tip>

- **Regular Reviews**: Conduct periodic access reviews to ensure permissions remain appropriate
- **Temporary Access**: Use time-limited access for contractors or temporary team members
- **Audit Trails**: Monitor user activity through comprehensive audit logs

### Password Policies

For organizations not using SSO, Cobalt enforces strong password policies:

- Minimum 12 characters
- Must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Password history prevents reuse of last 12 passwords
- Mandatory password changes every 90 days

## Monitoring and Auditing

### User Activity Logs

Track all user activities within the platform:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "action": "integration.created",
  "resource": "salesforce_integration",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0..."
}
```

### Access Reports

Generate reports on user access patterns:

- **Login Frequency**: Track how often users access the platform
- **Feature Usage**: Monitor which features are being used by whom
- **Permission Changes**: Log all permission modifications
- **Failed Access Attempts**: Track and alert on suspicious activity
