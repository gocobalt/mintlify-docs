Any integration can be setup as Custom App and they function similarly to other pre-built integrations available in Cobalt.

Similar to the native apps offered by Cobalt, Custom Apps provide the following features:

- Workflow builder for creating custom logic of your use-cases.
- Fully managed authentication of Key Based or OAuth 2.0 authentication.
- Access and run any provided API of the application.
- Create Actions for the APIs you will frequently use.


## Creating Custom Apps

A custom app can be created using any of the three methods offered by Cobalt. 

The prerequisites for building a Custom Integration of any app provider on Cobalt are:

- The app provider must have a public API.

- Have access to the app's API documentation.

- If the app provider uses OAuth authentication, create a developer account and developer application from the app provider.

Click on your preferred method and read about the detailed step of how you can add custom app with that method.
