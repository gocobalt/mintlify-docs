title: Workflow Testing
description: Workflow Testing in Cobalt enables you to test your workflow's functionality by running it with sample payloads as you build it.
---

It allows you to:

- Execute multiple test cases for a workflow by modifying the input payload.

- Test and inspect the output values of each workflow node.

- Use the Run Node button at the bottom of each step to execute it for the authenticated Linked Account.

## Pre-requisites for Workflow Testing

Before testing a workflow, ensure the following steps are completed:


<Accordion title="Configure a Linked Account" defaultOpen="true">
Click the `Testing` button in the workflow editor side menu and select a **[Linked Account](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/basics/linked_account)** under `Prerequisites` section.

If the Linked Account is not authenticated with the integration or if its authentication has expired, a warning will appear.

Click the **Authorize Application** button to reauthenticate or establish a connection with the integration.

Once authentication is complete, a **Connected**  status will be displayed.

<Check>Click on the next section to proceed.</Check>
</Accordion>




<Accordion title="Provide a Sample Payload" defaultOpen="true">

Enter a payload with data to be used during workflow testing.
A sample payload will automatically load based on the event trigger defined in the workflow.
Modify the sample payload whenever required to suit your testing requirements.

<Tip>
If you want to reset your payload, simply click on the `Reset` button.
</Tip>
</Accordion>


After completing these steps, click on the `Save` button above. 

<Check>Your workflow is now ready for testing.</Check>

## Steps to test

Cobalt provides options for testing both ndividual nodes or the entire workflow.

#### Testing Node
<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Node">
    Click on the node you want to test.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Node">
    In the node, switch to `Input/Output` tab and click on `Run Node` button.
<Warning>Testing for Group Node and Pagination is currently not supported.</Warning>
    <img height="200" src="/images/Guides/Workflow/node_output.png" alt="Checking Input and Output of Test execution"/>
  </Step>

</Steps>

<Check>Once the node executes successfully, a checkmark appears on the node, indicating it has been tested.</Check>


#### Testing Entire Workflow


Open the testing modal present in the side menu.

Click on `Execute Workflow` button to perform a test execution and a **Run** log is generated with input and output of each node.

You can easily switch between the run logs to see the execution history.
<Warning>Since testing for Group nodes is not supported currently, you might not receive the logs of the group node.</Warning>

## Workflow Templating

In Cobalt workflows, you can use dynamic variables generated through **Run Node** test execution to seamlessly access data from previous nodes. This method allows you to incorporate tested node response data into subsequent nodes.

<Tip>
To learn more about how to do Templating in Cobalt, refer to the docs [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/workflow/templating).
</Tip>

Simply go to input field where you want to use variable within a node, select **Nodes** tab from the `Insert Variable` modal, choose the node whose response you want to access and select the field from that node response.
  <img height="200" src="/images/Guides/Workflow/response_example.png" alt="Using Node response as variable"/>

  In this example, we used the `id` received in the response when project was created and it's visible as `4.id` in the field which is of the format `<node_number>.<response_field>`.


This streamlined approach of Workflow Testing ensures that your workflows perform as expected before deploying them in production.
