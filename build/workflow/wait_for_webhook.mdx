title: Wait for Webhook Node
---
A webhook is an HTTP-based callback function that facilitates communication between the Cobalt Workflows and third-party systems. It can be used to receive data from other sources and then continue executing the workflow and use the data received.

## Node Functionality
It acts as a way to pause the workflow execution until a webhook payload is received. It can:

- Keeps the workflow execution in Running state until payload is received.
- Match the security headers of webhook.

## Configuring Node

In the node, the `Webhook URL` that is available should be configured in the third party application webhook setup to receive the payload in Cobalt.

Optionally, you could also setup `Security Headers` which will be matched with the headers received in the Webhook. If the headers match, Cobalt will successfully continue executing the workflow, else the node errors and the workflow stops.
