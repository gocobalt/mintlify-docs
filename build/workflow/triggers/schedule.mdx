title: Schedule Trigger
description: Run workflows automatically in a schedule.
---

The Schedule trigger is used for workflows that should run automatically at predefined times or intervals — without any external event.

This trigger is ideal for use cases such as sending regular reports or periodically syncing data.

## Trigger Types

Cobalt supports two types of schedule triggers in the Start Node.

#### 1. CRON Expression
Use this when you want precise control over when your workflow runs. You provide a standard CRON expression, which determines the run schedule based on UTC.

Example CRON values:

*/30 * * * * → Every 30 minutes

15 * * * * → At 15 minutes past every hour

0 9 * * * → At 9:00 AM every day

#### 2. Date/Time Intervals
This mode lets you specify exact date-time values for when the workflow should run.

You can define multiple run times by selecting:

- Date - Month - Year
- Hour - Minute - Second

- Timezone

And then click on `Add Date`.

Once you've added all the required intervals, click `Save`. When a user enables the workflow, it will execute at each configured time.


## Managing Schedules via API

Cobalt provides public APIs to let you manage scheduled jobs programmatically. You can register and control schedules for each linked account as needed.

Available APIs include:

- [Register Cron Schedule](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/schedule/register-cron)

- [Get All Scheduled Jobs](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/schedule/get-all-schedules)

- [Pause a Schedule](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/schedule/pause-schedule)

- [Resume a Schedule](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/schedule/resume-schedule)

- [Update a Schedule](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/schedule/update-schedule-job)

- [Delete a Schedule](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/schedule/delete-schedule)

These APIs make it easy to integrate and manage schedule-based workflows dynamically for your users.
