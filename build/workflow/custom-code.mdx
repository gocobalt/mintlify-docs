title: Custom Code Node
---
The Custom Code node in Cobalt enables users to execute custom code within workflows. Users can leverage their preferred programming language to create custom logic and functionality.

## Node Functionality

Custom Code node is like a code executor within workflows. It can:

- Modify structure of the data received;
- Perform operations on data;
- Filter data;
- Use supported external JS libraries in code;
<Tip>
To know more about all the libraries supported, refer [here](/build/workflow/custom-code#supported-javascript-libraries). 
</Tip>
- Any other operation that you want to using code;


## Custom Code Input Fields
To get started with Custom Code, first provide the `Input Parameters` as a key-value pair that you want to use in code and then select your preferred language.

In the Code section, the user can write their own custom code which they want to get executed within the **yourFunction**.

<CodeGroup>
```JavaScript axios
const axios = require('axios');

async function yourFunction(params) {
    const res = await axios.get("https://genshin-impact.up.railway.app/characters");

    return{
        data: res.data
    }
}
```
``` JavaScript lodash
const _ = require('lodash');

function yourFunction(params) {
    const array = [{ id: 3 }, { id: 1 }, { id: 2 }];
    const sortedData = _.sortBy(array, "id");

    return {
        data: sortedData
    };
}
