title: Sub Flows Node
---

This node allows you to call a workflow within another workflow using [Workflow API](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/workflow/workflow_api). For eg: If you have a standard error notification policy, you can create a Internal Conductor sub flow and then have all workflows call this for error notification. 

## Node Functionality

Sub Flows node allows you to use a workflow within a workflow. It can:

- Use all the Workflows created in the same application.
- Use any internal conductor workflow within a workflow.
- Use a workflow recursively by calling itself.
<Warning>
Ensure that you put a break condition in your workflow to avoid infinite recursion. For safeguards, Cobalt sets a limit of 1000 recursions incase a break condition is not available during recursion.
</Warning>
- Reduce the size of your workflows by converting repetitive steps into a separate workflow.

A workflow that is being used as a Sub-flow is triggered by a Workflow API call from another workflow instead of an event based trigger in an application.

<Tip>
To learn more about how to fire a Workflow API Call, refer to the doc [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/workflow/workflow_api#workflow-api-endpoints).
</Tip>

## Example Usage of Sub Flow

Consider a use-case where you want to split a full name into first name and last name and then use it in your workflow.

These involves two steps, first creating workflow which splits the full name and the second step is the workflow which will call the first one as a Sub Flow.


#### Step 1: Creating a Sub Flow

<Accordion title="Creating a Sub Flow." defaultOpen="true">

Let's create an Internal Conductor for this so that it can be used in all the integrations' workflows.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Internal Conductor">   
Go to [Internal Conductor](https://app.gocobalt.io/internal-workflows) in dashboard, and create a new workflow by clicking on `+ Add Workflow`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup Workflow API Call">
    In the `Start` Node, set the trigger as **API Call** and add `full_name` in the payload which you will receive as an input from your main workflow and click on `Save`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Split Full Name">
    Connect a Custom Code node to Start Node and write a function that splits the full name.
    <Info>
    Learn more about how to use Custom Code Node [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/workflow/custom-code).
    </Info>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Return Workflow Response">
    Now simply return the response of this node in [Response Node](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/workflow/response) so that it can be used as a Sub Flow.
    <Note>
    Since Sub Flows work using Workflow API Call, it is necessary to return the data that you want to use in Response Node.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>
</Accordion>

#### Step 2: Using the Sub Flow
<Accordion title="Using the Sub Flow" defaultOpen="true">

Since you have successfully created the workflow which splits the full name, you now want to use it in your workflow.

Let's use it in a HubSpot workflow to create a new contact where we need to provide the first and last name separately.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to HubSpot Workflow">
    Create a new workflow or in an existing workflow for Creating Contact, add a Sub Flows Node.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Node">
    Select the sub flow that you created in [Step 1](/build/workflow/sub_flows#step-1-creating-a-sub-flow) in **Select Workflow**. Once selected, you will see the payload that you added in the Sub Flow and add the full name that you want to pass as an input in the `full_name` key.
    <img height="200" src="/images/Guides/Workflow/select-flow.png" alt="Selecting Sub Flow in Cobalt"/> 
    <Note>
    We are passing the full name from our event using [Workflow Templating](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/workflow/templating).
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>
</Accordion>
**Synchronous Execution Toggle**

By default the toggle is turned off and only returns the execution ID which you can then use in the [/response](https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/workflow/workflow_api#response-api) API to get the response returned by the Sub Flow.

If the toggle is turned On i.e Synchronous Execution is true, the API response will include both the execution_id and the return_value object containing response as set in the Response node.

In conclusion, sub flows improve your workflow efficiency and by grouping a set of actions into a separate workflow instead of repeating them in the same workflow, you reduce the effort needed to change and test the steps.
