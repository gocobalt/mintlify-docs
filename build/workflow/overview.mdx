## About Workflows

Once your users have connected their third-party app accounts, you can then connect data between your application and your users' apps using Workflows.
Workflows consist of [Triggers](/build/workflow/triggering_workflow) and [Actions](/build/workflow/overview#actions), allowing for seamless automation and data flow between applications.

With Workflows, users can easily implement common integration use cases such as pushing data from their application to users' apps, receiving real-time updates through webhooks, and enabling non-technical teams to configure integrations without coding.

Here are some examples of Workflows for popular integrations:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Slack" icon="slack">
    Send notifications from your application to Slack channels.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Salesforce" icon="salesforce">
    Sync contacts from your application to Salesforce CRM.
  </Card>
  <Card title="HubSpot" icon="hubspot">
    Sync contacts between HubSpot and your application.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Google Calendar" icon="calendar">
    Create events in Google Calendar based on events in your application.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>



The Workflow Builder simplifies the integration process, empowering developers to create seamless and efficient data flows between applications with ease.

## Triggers

**All workflows start with a trigger**, which determines when the workflow will run and how data is passed into the workflow. Triggers are setup in the `Start Node` of workflow. Available workflow trigger types include:

<Accordion title="App Events">
  App Events are custom events that are sent from your application via the Cobalt SDK or API to trigger Workflows. 

In general, App Events are useful for triggering workflows that map data from your application to your users' apps. For example, you might send a `Contact Created` App Event from your application to trigger a Workflow that creates a matching contact in your users' Salesforce CRM.

<Info>
An App Event can be used to trigger multiple workflows.  This is useful in cases where you may want the same event to trigger similar workflows across different integrations.
</Info>

Learn more about **Events** in our guide [here](/build/basics/events).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Default App Triggers">
  
Default App triggers can be used to run workflows based on events in your users' apps. For example, you might want to trigger a workflow whenever new contacts 
are created in your users' Salesforce account, to sync contacts to your application in real-time.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Schedule">
  The Scheduler trigger is used for workflows that should run automatically at a scheduled time or interval. 

+ Minutes
   (e.g. every 30 minutes)
+ Hourly
   (e.g. every hour at 15 minutes past the hour)
+ Daily
   (e.g. every 2 days at 9:00 am)

<Note>
The minimum time that can be set in scheduler should be greater than 5 minutes.
</Note>

Once deployed, the workflow will run automatically at the designated time for all users who have activated the workflow.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Workflow API">
  The Workflow API in Cobalt allows users to execute workflows programmatically instead of relying on event-based triggers. This API-based execution provides flexibility in triggering workflows directly through an API call.

  <Tip>

## Actions

Workflow actions helps you to create complex workflows. You can drag and drop them on the workflow canvas as `nodes` of a workflow, inter-connect
and configure them to achieve required flow. These actions can be broadly categorized as:

<Accordion title="Cobalt's Native actions">
  These actions do not make any API calls themselves but help as utility tools for making workflows.

There are various utility nodes currently provided by Cobalt. You can learn more about any of the node by clicking on its card below.
<CardGroup cols={2}>

    This action takes input parameters and uses them to manipulate the data using custom code.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Delay" icon="stopwatch" href="https://docs.gocobalt.io/build/workflow/delay">
   Delay allows you to pause the execution of next step till a certain time. 
  </Card>

<Accordion title="Third party application actions">
  Cobalt supports 100+ third party applications on its platform. Users can connect to these applications through Cobalt to make use of their APIs. 

When you select an application from the `Apps` list to create a workflow, you can find it's Native node in the right panel along with the other actions. Drag and drop it on the  workflow canvas to make use of the the application's APIs supported by Cobalt.

#### HTTP Request
Users can also make any custom API call to the selected application that is not available with Cobalt as an action using the HTTP request.
Simply setup the API in the node with all the required params like `Method`, `URL`, `Request Body` etc. and you are good to go.
