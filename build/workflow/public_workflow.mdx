description: Public workflows in Cobalt allow linked accounts to create and execute their own workflows.

## Overview

Public workflows operate in the production environment, enabling real-time automation and execution.

Below is a sample implementation of public workflows once you have embedded it into your platform.

Since public workflows are designed to be live, any modifications are made in draft mode before being published. Users can:

- Edit the workflow in draft mode.
- Test changes using Workflow Testing.
- Publish the draft to update the live workflow.

Once published, the new workflow state becomes live, ensuring seamless execution.

## Public Workflow Types

Public workflows can be created at two levels:

<Accordion title="App-Level Public Workflows">
Created when a user authenticates with an integration (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot).

These workflows are tied to the specific appâ€™s linked account.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Account-Level Public Workflows (Internal Conductor Workflows)">
These are not linked to any specific integration and are used for internal automation on Cobalt account level.

</Accordion>

## Embed Public Workflows 

To embed the public workflow into your platform, use the following iframe:
```bash
<iframe
    src={ `https://app.gocobalt.io/workflows/${ workflowId }?token=${ cobaltSessionToken }` }
    height="100%"
    width="100%"
    style={{
        border: "none",
    }}
/>
```
You need to provide the [Workflow Id](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/public_workflows/get_public_workflows) and [Session Token](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/session-token/generate-token-for-linked-account).

## Creating Public Workflows

To create a Public workflow, simply use Cobalt's API
```bash Create Public Workflow
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v2/public/workflow \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {Session_token}' \
  --data '{
  "name": "<string>",
  "slug": "<string>",
  "description": "<string>"
}'
```
<Tip>
Learn more about the Create Public Workflow API [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/api-reference/public_workflows/create_public_workflow).
</Tip>

To create a draft or editable version of the workflow, use the following cURL:
```bash Create Draft version
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.gocobalt.io/api/v2/public/workflow/:workflow_id/edit \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {Session_token}' \
```

## Editing and Publishing Public Workflows

To modify a public workflow, follow these steps:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Edit mode">
    Click on the `+ Edit Workflow` button.
    <img height="200" src="/images/Concepts/internal-public-workflow.png" alt="Edit a Public Workflow"/>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update and Publish">
    Make the required changes in the workflow while you are in Edit mode  and click `Publish` to make the workflow live.
    <Note>User config is not available in Public workflows, so dataslots or mapping selected by the user cannot be used in workflows.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save as Draft">
    If you do not wish to publish the changes, click `Cancel`, and the live workflow remains unchanged, while your changes are saved as draft.
    <Info>Draft workflows persist until they are published, allowing users to return and modify them anytime before finalizing.</Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Executing Public Workflows

Public workflows are triggered just like regular workflows in Cobalt. The execution depends on the event selected in the Start node.
Once live, the workflow runs based on its configured triggers, ensuring seamless automation.
