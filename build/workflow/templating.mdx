title: Templating in Workflows
---
## Overview

Cobalt supports **templating (dynamic variables)** in creating workflows. This essentially means that users can use these variables in their application workflows and [API Proxies](https://docs.gocobalt.io/guides/developer-settings/api_proxy) and [authorization settings](https://docs.gocobalt.io/guides/developer-settings/overview). 

Using these templates, users can access data from previous nodes in workflows and end-users **UDF**.

The templates are keywords enclosed within double-curly braces `{{}}`, with specific use cases.

Cobalt dynamic variables and their templating can be broadly categorized as:

## 1. Workflow dynamic variables



Workflow dynamic variables are used to access data from previous nodes.  Every node in a workflow returns some data in the form of a response object. 

Data from a node can be accessed either directly from the response object using a template or by accessing as variables generated through test execution of nodes:
  

<Accordion title="Access using template">

The following template is used within Cobalt to access the response object of any other node in the workflow:

  `{{node.<node number>.response:<Response object property>}}`

OR

`{{node.<node number>.response}}`,  if one wishes to access the complete response object.

For example, one can access the first item of response from node 15.

It can be accessed as: `{{node.15.response:0}}`.

Or if one wants to access the "name" field of the item, it can be accessed as `{{node.15.response:0.name}}`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Access using Test Run variables">

  In Cobalt workflows, you can use variables generated from tested node responses to access data dynamically.

  To use variables generated from node test runs, ensure that the workflow testing pre-requisites are satisfied and you have run a test execution on the node whose response you want to access.

  <Tip>
Learn more about Workflow Testing and it's pre-requisites [here](https://docs.gocobalt.io/concepts/workflow/workflow_testing).
  </Tip>

Now follow the steps given below to use these variables:
<Steps>

  <Step title="Select the node">
    Go to the node where you want to use the variable and click on the input field where the variable is needed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose the node with required response">
    From the `Insert Variable` modal, select the **Nodes** tab and click on the down facing arrow button to expand the node response.
    <img height="200" src="/images/Guides/Workflow/response_example.png" alt="Using Node response as variable"/>

    In this example, we used the `id` received in the response when project was created and it's visible as `4.id` in the field which is of the format `<node_number>.<response_field>`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Response not available">
    If the selected node doesn't have resonse as variables, then you need to click on `Run node` to perform a test execution of that node.
    <img height="200" src="/images/Guides/Workflow/run_example.png" alt="Run Node for response variables"/>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If the structure of the response object changes of a node (e.g., due to a different input payload), simply perform another test run on the node with the modified payload.

The updated response structure will now be available for use as variables in other nodes.
</Note>

## 2. Instance metadata variables


  An instance refers to a workflow execution instance. A workflow or an API proxy can access various instance data on the run-time such as, 

- Event name - `{{instance_meta_data.event_name}}`

- Config id - `{{instance_meta_data.config_id}}`

- Start time of the execution / Instance creation - `{{instance_meta_data.instance_created_time}}`

- Instance id - `{{instance_meta_data.instance_id}}`

## 3. Linked account variables

Linked account variables are used to pass on Linked account-specific data throughout the Cobalt platform. The following are the variables that be used on the execution runtime:

- UDFs - `{{linked_account.udf.<UDF property>}}`

- Authorization data - `{{linked_account.auth_credentials.<auth properties>}}`
