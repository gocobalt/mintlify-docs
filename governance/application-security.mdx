title: Application Security
description: At Cobalt, we prioritize the security of our systems, services, and customer data. Our security approach is built on industry best practices, proactive risk management, and continuous monitoring to ensure robust protection against threats.

## Key Security Measures

We implement a range of security controls to protect our infrastructure and customer data:

- **Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. We use **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** to encrypt data in transit between clients and servers, ensuring that all communications are secure. Additionally, data at rest is encrypted using **AES-256 encryption**.
- **Access Control**: We use strict role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized personnel have access to critical systems.
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enforced for accessing internal systems and customer-facing services.
- **Regular Audits**: Our systems undergo regular vulnerability assessments and security audits to identify and address potential risks.
- **Incident Response**: We have a defined incident response plan in place to quickly respond to and mitigate security incidents.

## Threat Detection & Monitoring

Our team continuously monitors our systems for potential threats using advanced intrusion detection systems (IDS), real-time logging, and anomaly detection tools. This proactive monitoring allows us to quickly detect and respond to suspicious activities.

## Secure Development Practices

We follow a secure development lifecycle (SDLC) to ensure that security is incorporated at every stage of software development, from design to deployment. This includes:

- Code reviews and static analysis to identify vulnerabilities early.
- Secure coding practices to minimize common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Regular security testing, including penetration testing and code scanning for vulnerabilities.

## Security Training & Awareness

All employees undergo regular security training to stay updated on the latest threats, secure coding practices, and incident response protocols. We promote a security-first culture across all teams.

## Reporting & Transparency

Customers can request a copy of our security reports through our dedicated [Security Center](https://security.gocobalt.io/) or by emailing us at **support@gocobalt.io**.
